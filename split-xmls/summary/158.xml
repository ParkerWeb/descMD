                <p>The text and script of CCCC MS 158, dating to c. 1450-1475, are a very good example of the sort of
                    manuscript made for English humanists of the middle years of the fifteenth century. It is a copy of
                    two works of Cicero on rhetoric. It was written in Italian-influenced humanist script by the scribe,
                    John Pacy, who also worked on Cambridge, Pembroke MS 235, which is dated 1464. M. R. James thought
                    that it came from the cathedral priory of Christ Church, Canterbury, but it does not appear to be
                    listed in the catalogue. Matthew Parker, misled by the Roman form of the script, notes on f. 1 that
                    the book belonged to Theodore, the seventh-century archbishop of Canterbury. The book contains fine
                    decorative initials containing grotesques and dragons in grisaille.</p>
