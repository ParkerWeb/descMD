                <p>CCCC MS 536 contains a single work, the <title>Malogranatum</title> by a member of the Cistercian
                    monastery of Königsaal (Zbraslav), near Prague. The name of its author has been controversial. He
                    was first thought to be a monk called Gallus, then one called Peter, and most recently the abbot of
                    Zbraslav in the second half of the fourteenth century, Iohannes of Frankenstein, has been proposed.
                    The text is in the form of spiritual advice as a guide on the road to perfection. Attendance at
                    Mass, and in particular frequent communion, is considered as essential to achieve this. The book was
                    probably made at Prague in the first quarter of the fifteenth century, and preserves its
                    contemporary binding with straps and bosses of bone or ivory. This volume is part of the Elbing
                    collection; a group of manuscripts which belonged to a Brigittine convent at Elbing (Elblag), near
                    Gdansk. The collection was donated to Corpus Christi College by either Richard Pernham (1583?-1628)
                    or his wife Mary, whose name is in many of these books.</p>
