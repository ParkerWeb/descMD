                <p>CCCC MS 446 is a fifteenth-century copy of the <title>Quadrilogus de uita Sancti Thomae
                        Cantuariensis</title> by the Benedictine monk Elias of Evesham (fl. c. 1200), written in 1198-9.
                    It is the recension of the text known as the 'second' version, although confusingly recent
                    scholarship has suggested that the 'second' version is earlier than the 'first'. It was dedicated to
                    Henry de Longchamp, abbot of Crowland. This manuscript has been dated to the second quarter of the
                    fifteenth century on the grounds of its decoration. The 'Jacobus Tutyll' of the inscription on f. vi
                    recto has not been identified, and the manuscript's provenance before it came into the hands of
                    Parker is not known. Parker compared it with a manuscript owned by John Twyne (d. 1581) and made
                    notes about the omissions in MS 446 at the end.</p>
