            <div xml:id="CCC355" n="MS 355">
                <p>The commentaries on the Epistle to the Romans and on Genesis contained in CCCC MS 355 are by John
                    Colet (1467-1519), one of the early humanists in England, who had been to Italy and was influenced
                    by early Renaissance scholarship. The commentary on Romans originated as a lecture in Oxford given
                    in the late 1490s, and was expanded and revised, as in this manuscript copy, addressed to a young
                    man named Edmund. It heralds a departure from the still prevalent scholastic mode of exegesis. It is
                    written in humanist script by Peter Meghen (1466/7-1540), a Brabantine scribe who worked extensively
                    for the English early sixteenth-century humanists. The manuscript was probably made in the first or
                    second decades of the sixteenth century. John Colet seems first to have employed Meghen in 1505,
                    although he continued to work in England into the 1520s. Blank spaces indicate the intention to
                    include miniatures and ornamental intials, but regrettably this work was never carried out.</p>
