                <p>CCCC MS 98A is the second of three genealogical rolls in Matthew Parker's collection. It must date to
                    some time after 1453, the date of birth of Henry VI's son Edward of Westminster, an event recorded
                    on the roll. A dating has been suggested as c. 1475-1500. It is not clear whether this roll was ever
                    in Parker's possession, although it would be consistent with his interest in all aspects of British
                    history. A note in the hand of Matthew Parker's son, John, however, records what may be this roll at
                    the end of the Parker Register, the list of Parker's books in <ref type="ms" target="CCC575">CCCC MS
                        575</ref> compiled in 1574-1575.</p>
