                <p>This manuscript, CCCC MS 380, is the unique copy of Robert of Cricklade OSA (d. after 1188),
                        <title>Speculum fidei</title>, which was written after 1170. Robert was prior of St
                    Frideswide's, Oxford, and this work is in the form of a commentary on the <title>Sentences</title>
                    of Peter Lombard (c. 1095-1160). It has fine historiated and ornamental initials by the Simon
                    Master, an illuminator who worked for St Albans Abbey and may have been a layman. This manuscript,
                    however, is not in St Albans script and seems to have been made elsewhere. A copy of this text was
                    seen by John Leland (1506-52) at Malmesbury and M. R. James suggested this might be that book, but
                    Ker has rejected this theory.</p>
