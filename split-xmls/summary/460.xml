                <p>The texts by various hands in CCCC MS 460, dating to the thirteenth or fourteenth century, are
                    primarily aids for the study of the Bible, but with two tracts on the mass at the end. The first
                    category comprises the <title>Correctorium totius Bibliae</title> attributed to Robert Grossesteste
                    (d. 1253), the <title>Corrogationes Promethei</title> by Alexander Nequam OSA (1157-1217), and
                    Bartholomew Cotton OSB (d. 1321/2), <title>Compilationes de libro Britonis</title>, which is based
                    on William Brito OFM (fl. late thirteenth century), <title>Expositiones uocabulorum Bibliae</title>.
                    One of the commentaries on the mass is by Hugh of Saint-Cher OP (c. 1200-63). The book also has the
                        <title>Constitutiones de uita clericorum</title> by John Stratford (d. 1348), archbishop of
                    Canterbury, Ker rejects M. R. James's suggestion that the book might have come from Norwich
                    cathedral priory.</p>
