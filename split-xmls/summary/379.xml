            <div xml:id="CCC379" n="MS 379">
                <p>CCCC MS 379 is one of the notebooks of Robert Talbot (1505/6–1558), an antiquarian best remembered
                    for his interest in Anglo-Saxon texts. It contains notes and excerpts from texts in Latin, Greek and
                    Old English from both manuscripts and early printed books as well as runic inscriptions. This
                    notebook has attracted attention both as an artefact of sixteenth-century efforts to learn Old
                    English, and due to the transcription of a large portion of the preface to Genesis by Ælfric of
                    Eynsham (d. 1010) from the now lost first folio of BL Cotton Claudius B.IV. Much of the material in
                    this notebook relates to Talbot's interest in topographical nomenclature, such as his extensive
                    notes on the British section of the <title>Itinerarii Antonini</title>. The Latin version of
                    Oppian's <title>Halieutica</title> with a brief biographical note on the author on ff. 2r-7v appears
                    to be a translation of the Greek version published in the early sixteenth century.</p>
