            <div xml:id="CCC422" n="MS 422">
                <p>CCCC MS 422 consists of two parts, which were together by the twelfth century. The first, a
                    tenth-century volume, contains two Old English texts about the dialogue between Solomon and Saturn,
                    one in poetry (also found in <ref type="ms" target="CCC041">CCCC MS 41</ref>) and one in prose. This
                    is an example of a type of Old English wisdom literature which was influenced by Old Norse examples.
                    The second part is a Missal, known as <title>The Red Book of Darley</title> because of its later
                    provenance at the church of St Helen, Darley Dale, in the Lake District. Its Easter table suggest
                    that it was written in the 1060s, probably circa 1061. Its calendar contains rare feasts pertaining
                    to Sherborne in Dorset, and the manuscript was probably written there. It has been suggested that it
                    is associable with Ælfwold, bishop of Sherborne 1045–1062. The Missal section contains ornamental
                    initials and drawings of Christ between angels and of the Crucifixion. This manuscript was given to
                    Parker by Richard Wendesley.</p>
