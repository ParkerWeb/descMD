                <p>A luxury copy, dating from c. 1300, perhaps made in Paris, of the <title>Speculum historiale</title>,
                    Books XVII-XXIV, by the Dominican, Vincent of Beauvais (1189/94-c. 1264), having fine illuminated
                    initials and decorative borders. CCCC MSS <ref type="ms" target="CCC013">13</ref>, 14 are vols. II
                    and III of a three-volume set, of which volume I is Cambridge, St John's College MS B.21. It
                    belonged to St Augustine's Abbey, Canterbury, and this volume has on the flyleaf the name of Abbot
                    Thomas as owner. This must be Thomas of Findon (1283-1310) who may himself have commissioned these
                    three volumes. This is an encyclopaedia of history which was extremely popular in the Middle Ages,
                    and exists in printed copies as late as the seventeenth century.</p>
