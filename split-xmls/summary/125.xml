            <div xml:id="CCC125" n="MS 125">
                <p>MS 125 contains sixteenth-century copies of <title>Apologia</title> and <title>Appellatio contra
                        capitulum Coloniense</title> by Hermann von Wied, Archbishop of Cologne (d. 1551) and Martin
                    Bucer's <title>Constans defensio</title>. The entire volume is probably in the hand of Martin Brem,
                    Bucer's amanuensis, who also added a dedication to Matthew Parker. Martin Bucer (1491-1551) was a
                    German Reformation theologian who moved to England in 1549 as a result of Archbishop Cranmer's
                    invitation and Bucer's refusal to accept the Augsburg Interim (the temporary agreement brokered
                    between the Catholics and Protestants at the Diet of Augsburg in 1548). Hermann von Wied was
                    Archbishop of Cologne from 1515 to 1546. Initially hostile to Luther and the reformers, he
                    eventually became sympathetic to the reformers' cause and was forced to resign his
                    archbishopric.</p>
