                <p>CCCC MS 324 contains a luxurious fourteenth-century copy of <title>Le Miroir des dames</title>, a
                    translation into French of the <title>Speculum dominarum</title>, a didactic text written for Jeanne
                    de Navarre (d. 1305), wife of Philip IV of France, by her confessor, Durand de Champagne OFM. The
                    manuscript is described as bearing the sign manual of Charles V of France (1338-80), and in 1411 the
                    catalogue of the French royal library recorded this manuscript as still being in the collection at
                    the Louvre palace, where it is described as 'de bonne lettre de forme' in a linen cover with two
                    gold clasps. It contains a miniature of the presentation of the book to Jeanne by her confessor, and
                    many illuminated borders and initials.</p>
