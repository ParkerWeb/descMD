                <p>CCCC MS 170 contains an early sixteenth-century copy of the letter book of Nicholas Collys, a notary
                    who flourished during the second half of the fifteenth century and into the sixteenth century. His
                    notarial mark can be found on numerous documents including one in <ref type="ms" target="CCC108"
                        >CCCC MS 108</ref> and one in Hertford County Record Office, ASA 4. As Collys was connected to
                    the college of Stoke by Clare in Suffolk, this volume probably came to Parker's attention while he
                    was Dean there.</p>
