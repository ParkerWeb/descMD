                <p>CCCC MS 81 is a large and handsomely decorated paper manuscript of the mid-fifteenth century, copied
                    by Demetrios Xanthopoulos, who worked in the circle of Cardinal Bessarion (1403-72). It contains
                    Homer, <title>Iliad</title>, Quintus of Smyrna, <title>Posthomerica</title> and Homer,
                        <title>Odyssey</title>. There are intermittent Homeric scholia in the hand of Demetrios
                    Chalkondyles, the scholar who supervised the production of the editio princeps of Homer in 1488;
                    some of the scholia on <title>Odyssey</title> yield new textual evidence. A circular cartouche on
                    p.1 with the name 'Theodoros' in gold letters is probably a sign of Theodore Gaza's (c.1400-1475)
                    ownership, but may have led to the belief that the book (along with CCCC MSS <ref type="ms"
                        target="CCC224">224</ref> and <ref type="ms" target="CCC248">248</ref> and six other Cambridge
                    MSS) came from Theodore of Tarsus (602-690). Notes by Parker and others suggest that the book was
                    found at Canterbury, possibly as part of the library of St Augustine's Abbey.</p>
