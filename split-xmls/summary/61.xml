                <p>The copy of Chaucer's <title>Troilus and Criseyde</title> in CCCC MS 61 was made c. 1415-25, long
                    after the poet's death in 1400. The poem was written at some time before 1385. This copy was planned
                    as a luxury edition to contain over ninety illustrations, but only the full-page frontispiece was
                    painted, with blank spaces left at the positions intended for the other pictures. In that
                    frontispiece Chaucer is shown reading his poem to the English court. The patron of this manuscript
                    is unknown, but it is likely to have been the prominent male figure dressed in a gold-embroidered
                    costume in the centre of the courtly group. The book belonged in 1570 to the author, Stephen Batman,
                    a chaplain of Matthew Parker, and shortly after became incorporated in the archbishop's
                    collection.</p>
