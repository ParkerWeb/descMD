                <p>Although CCCC MS 465 is frequently described as the Customary of the Benedictine Cathedral priory of
                    Norwich, the content is that of the Ordinal rather than the Customary. An Ordinal contains
                    directions for the liturgical services throughout the Church year. The dating of the main text is
                    1258-65, but the calendar of Norwich Cathedral Priory at the beginning of the book was added
                    1278-88. The pressmark of the priory is on the flyleaf, and an inscription recording it as the
                    'Ordinale fratris R. de Lok.'.</p>
