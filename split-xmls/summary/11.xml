                <p>CCCC MS 11 is a twelfth-century copy of Hrabanus Maurus's ninth-century encyclopaedic text <title>De
                        rerum naturis</title>, also known as <title>De uniuerso</title>. Neil Ker rejected M. R. James's
                    suggestion that the manuscript was a product of the cathedral priory of Christ Church, Canterbury,
                    and more recent work by Schipper has stated that the manuscript is of uncertain provenance, but
                    certainly English. The manuscript has been studied very little, considered as a late copy of the
                    text and thus of lesser interest; however, it is perhaps a useful witness to a renewed interest in
                    Carolingian scholarship in twelfth-century England.</p>
