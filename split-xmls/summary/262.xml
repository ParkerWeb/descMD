                <p>CCCC MS 262 contains a fourteenth-century copy of the <title>Historia rerum Anglicarum</title> of
                    William of Newburgh (1135/6-c. 1198). The version of the text in this manuscript was much criticized
                    by Howlett in his edition of 1884, who described it as corrupted and with many elementary copying
                    errors. Nevertheless, the text as found in this manuscript was used for collating the English
                    Historical Society's edition of 1856. This edition was in turn used by Joseph Stevenson as the basis
                    for his translation of the work that also appeared in 1856. The provenance of the manuscript is
                    unknown.</p>
