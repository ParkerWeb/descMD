            <div xml:id="CCC462" n="MS 462">
                <p>CCCC MS 462 was originally at Dover Priory, as is well attested by the press marks and the presence
                    of two fourteenth-century copies of documents relating to the priory - Henry I's charter of 1131 by
                    which Dover became a daughter house of Christ Church, Canterbury and Pope Innocent II's confirmation
                    of the same grant. In addition, the manuscript contains twelfth-century copies of a recapitulation
                    of the Bible from Genesis to Ruth, the <title>Constitutions</title> of Lanfranc OSB (d. 1089), an
                    index to proper nouns and Greek and Hebrew words appearing in the Old Testament and the account of
                    the martyrdom of Faith, Hope and Charity. Five major items are listed in a note on the flyleaf,
                    which demonstrates that the final text, a thirteenth-century copy of the <title>Purgatorium Sancti
                        Patricii</title> sometimes attributed to H[enry?] of Sawtry OCist (fl. twelfth century), was
                    added subsequently.</p>
