                <p>CCCC MS 532 is part of the Elbing collection brought back from the abandoned Brigittine monastery at
                    what is now Elblag in Poland by Richard Pernham in the early 1620s and donated to Corpus Christi
                    either by himself or by his wife Mary, whose name is inscribed in many books of the collection. This
                    manuscript is a large fifteenth-century collection of sermons, some attributed to Pope Innocent III
                    (1160/61-1216 - pope 1198-1216), copied in a number of hands. The original binding, badly damaged,
                    was repaired in the twentieth century.</p>
