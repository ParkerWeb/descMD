                <p>The psalter in CCCC MS 468, dating to c. 1250, has parallel Latin-Greek text, although the Greek is
                    written in Latin script. It contains a calendar of the Benedictine Abbey of Ramsey and probably
                    belonged to the prior, Gregory of Huntingdon (fl. c. 1290). On the front flyleaf are the cipher
                    characters of a Greek system of numbers brought back from Greece by John of Basingstoke, archdeacon
                    of Leicester (d. 1252). The book also contains a section of verses concerned with prognostics,
                    proverbs and the world of nature.</p>
