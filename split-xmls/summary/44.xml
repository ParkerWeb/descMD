                <p>This handsome manuscript contains a <title>Pontifical</title>. On script grounds it has been
                    attributed to Canterbury, probably St Augustine's rather than Christ Church; however its text has
                    been held to show that it was made for use at Christ Church, Canterbury. The script of CCCC MS 44
                    shows it to have been written at some point during the middle two quarters of the eleventh century,
                    but a more precise dating is arguably possible given the association of the coronation ordo it
                    contains (the third recension of the second ordo) with William the Conqueror. This association is by
                    no means generally accepted. The distinctive mark on f. 3 shows that the manuscript was at Ely in
                    the later Middle Ages. It has been suggested that it might have been part of the treasure of
                    Archbishop Stigand (1052-72), with which he fled to Ely shortly before his death in 1072; clearly
                    this again depends on how one interprets the dating evidence of the manuscript's text.</p>
