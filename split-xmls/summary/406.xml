                <p>CCCC MS 406 contains a number of texts copied in a series of early thirteenth-century hands. Among
                    these is what is thought to be one of the earliest versions of the 'A' recension of Seneca's
                        <title>Tragoediae</title> to be copied in England. The text has been much used and discussed by
                    modern editors of Seneca's <title>Tragedies</title>. Alongside this there appears a broad variety of
                    texts typical of a monastic or university commonplace book including satirical verse, classical
                    history, cosmology and poetics. The texts include the <title>Architrenius</title> of Iohannes de
                    Alta Villa (fl. late twelfth century) and the <title>Anticlaudianus</title> of Alanus ab Insula
                    (Alain de Lille, c. 1128-1203), Joseph of Exeter (d. 1210) <title>Bellum Troianum</title>, Walter of
                    Châtillon (fl. c. 1160-90) <title>Alexandreis</title>, the first part of Bernardus Silvestris (d.
                    after 1159) <title>Cosmographia</title> (the <title>Megacosmos</title>) and Geoffrey of Vinsauf (d.
                    after 1200) <title>Poetria noua</title>. There has been some suggestion that the manuscript has an
                    Oxford provenance, but when and how this manuscript passed into Parker's possession is not
                    known.</p>
