                <p>CCCC MS 245 is an early sixteenth-century volume containing the New Testament in English. It has no
                    known association with Matthew Parker; but a hand-written addition to a college-owned copy of the
                    Stanley catalogue records this manuscript was donated to the college in 1745 by John Duncombe
                    (1729-86). Duncombe was an undergraduate and later Fellow of Corpus Christi who went on to combine
                    his career in the church with life as a celebrated critic and poet. Duncombe frequently contributed
                    to <title>The Gentleman's Magazine</title> under the pseudonym 'Crito' and enjoyed success with his
                    poem <title>An Evening's Contemplation in a College</title>, a burlesque of Gray's <title>Elegy in a
                        Country Churchyard</title>. Perhaps the quatrains at the end of each gospel in this manuscript
                    are Duncombe's early attempts at poetic expression.</p>
