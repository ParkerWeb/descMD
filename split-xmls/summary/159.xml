                <p>CCCC MS 159, dating to the first half of the fifteenth century, is a copy of Gregory the Great's
                    Forty Homilies on the Gospels, but is not significant in the textual tradition. It contains a
                    medieval price mark of thirteen shillings and four pence. It is one of the few surviving Corpus
                    manuscripts which was already in the college's collection when the Parker manuscripts arrived, as it
                    has been identified as one of the items in Thomas Markaunt's bequest of 1439, there valued at
                    fourteen shillings. Markaunt was a fellow of the college and left it 76 volumes, with detailed
                    instructions for their use including complex arrangements for lending them out among the Master and
                    Fellows. However, many of these books had been lost by the middle of the sixteenth century, and
                    others were absorbed into the Parkerian collection. James suggested that MS 159 originally came from
                    Norwich, but subsequent scholarship has shown that its classmark "B 53" is not in the right format;
                    Norwich classmarks used a lower-case Roman number after the letter.</p>
