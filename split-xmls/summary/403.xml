                <p>CCCC MS 403, in Greek, is one of the books believed in Parker's time to have come from Canterbury and
                    ultimately from Theodore of Tarsus (d. 690), archbishop of Canterbury. It is a typical late
                    fifteenth-century paper copy of the three most commonly studied plays of Euripides,
                        <title>Hecuba</title>, <title>Orestes</title> (wrongly entitled <title>Electra</title>) and
                        <title>Phoenissae</title>, with Palaeologan scholia. It is written by two hands (A: ff. 1-41v;
                    B: ff. 42-118r).</p>
