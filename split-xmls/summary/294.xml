                <p>This twelfth- or thirteenth-century manuscript contains various works by Hugh of Saint-Victor (d.
                    1141), as well as texts attributed to Hildebert of Lavardin (c.1055-1133). The volume also contains
                    a loose vellum leaf of the fifteenth century containing miscellaneous texts, including Middle
                    English verses on 'the leaps of Christ'. This manuscript belonged to Richard Mabot, who graduated
                    from the University of Cambridge in 1507-8 and later became canon of Lincoln Cathedral.</p>
