                <p>This Bible from St Albans, CCCC MS 48, dating to c. 1170, is part of a group of manuscripts produced
                    at the abbey during the abbacies of Abbot Simon (1167-83) and Abbot Warin (1183-95). Related in text
                    and decoration are two other St Albans Bibles of this period, Eton College MS 26 and Dublin, Trinity
                    College MS 51 (A.2.2). The main artist of the Corpus Bible also worked for the Abbey of St Bertin
                    and may be French in origin; he seems to have been a travelling illuminator. The book has thirteen
                    historiated initials some of them on separate pieces of vellum stuck onto the page. The version of
                    the Vulgate in this Bible has been classified by Glunz as 'Lanfranc's Scholastic Text'. The book is
                    much smaller than most twelfth-century Bibles, but is considerably larger than the small 'pocket'
                    versions which become popular in the middle years of the thirteenth century. An unusual feature of
                    the page format is a three (and occasionally four) column text.</p>
