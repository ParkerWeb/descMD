                <p>CCCC MS 252, written in the early fourteenth century, which has an inscription of ownership by John
                    de Reynham OSB, a monk of Norwich cathedral priory, contains a compilation of texts, mainly of a
                    devotional nature. The main texts are the <title>Stimulus amoris</title>, written in the second half
                    of the thirteenth century, once ascribed to St Bonaventure OFM, but probably by James of Milan OFM
                    (fl. c. 1296), a commentary on the rule of St Benedict by Bernard Ayglier OSB (d. 1282), and a
                        <title>Life of St Helen</title> by Jocelin of Furness OCist (d. c. 1210).</p>
