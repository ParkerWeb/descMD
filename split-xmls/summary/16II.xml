                <p>Matthew Paris OSB (c. 1200-59), a Benedictine monk of St Albans Abbey, was their official chronicler
                    who wrote chronicles covering both world history and British history. These two volumes are of his
                    most important work, the <title>Chronica maiora</title>, covering world history, but with a
                    particular emphasis on that of Britain - vol I is CCCC MS 26 and vol II is CCCC MS 16, their
                    production dating to the period c. 1240-55. Matthew was also a talented artist who was both scribe
                    and illustrator of his own chronicles. These volumes have coloured marginal drawings, and also signs
                    and heraldic shields in the borders signifying the persons and incidents in their lives, and also
                    signifying their deaths, set beside the text passages mentioning these events. Recently, in 2003,
                    the prefatory section to MS 16 (ff. i recto - v verso), containing lists and genealogies of kings, a
                    diagram of the winds, itineraries, maps, and the picture of the elephant given by Louis IX to Henry
                    III, has been bound separately as MS 16I. The part containing the chronicle text itself, ff.
                    1v-282r, has been rebound as MS 16II.</p>
