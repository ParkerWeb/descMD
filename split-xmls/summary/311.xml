                <p>CCCC MS 311 is one of the many manuscripts in the collection that reflects Parker's interest in
                    British history. In this instance the text is a Latin prose <title>Brut</title> chronicle in a late
                    fifteenth- or early sixteenth-century hand that continues the account of events to 1437, and which
                    belongs to the family of extended versions that may have served as a textual model for the Middle
                    English 'Peculiar Version'. John Bale (1495-1563), the historian, mentions that such a text, with
                    the same incipit, was in the possession of one William Carey 'scriba' of Cheapside in the
                    mid-sixteenth century. This provenance is supported by a note on one of the flyleaves mentioning Dr
                    Edward Wotton (d.1555), a renowned physician who seems to have practiced in the Cheapside area of
                    London.</p>
