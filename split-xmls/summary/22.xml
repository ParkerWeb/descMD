                <p>The main text in CCCC MS 22 is an encyclopaedia, the <title>Etymologiae</title> of Isidore of Seville
                    (c. 560-636), which is preceded by an index of its subject matter. The <title>Etymologiae</title> is
                    a compilation of universal knowledge in twenty books covering topics such as grammar, medicine,
                    theology and geography. Natural history is also extensively covered, and this is the subject of
                    another text in the book, a <title>Bestiary</title>, illustrated with coloured drawings of the
                    animals, birds, fish and reptiles. It is one of the oldest extant copies of an illustrated bestiary
                    made in England. The book also contains one text of a very different character, the
                        <title>Synonyma</title>, a devotional dialogue by Isidore of Seville between the sinful soul and
                    a personification of reason. Recent scholarship dates the book to c. 1150-70, but its place of
                    origin is uncertain, although possibly the North of England, perhaps Durham. There is no evidence of
                    its medieval ownership.</p>
