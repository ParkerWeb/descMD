                <p>CCCC MS 312 is what might be termed a "<title>Libellus Sancti Augustini</title>", a book of
                    hagiographical material concerning St Augustine of Canterbury, predominantly by Goscelin of
                    Canterbury OSB (d. after 1114), formerly a monk of St Bertin. Goscelin came to England either
                    shortly before or shortly after the Norman Conquest, later becoming a monk of St Augustine's
                    Canterbury, and had a flourishing career as a hagiographer, especially of native English saints. He
                    wrote a number of works for the translations of major Canterbury saints in 1091, including these St
                    Augustine texts. This manuscript was written in the mid-twelfth century, and includes liturgical
                    material with music. Like <ref type="ms" target="CCC050">CCCC MS 50</ref> it seems to have been
                    owned by someone called Bachon, who wrote his name in it accompanied by a little flower, before it
                    came into the hands of Parker.</p>
