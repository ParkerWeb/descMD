                <p>CCCC MS 219, dating from the fifteenth century, is one of only two known surviving copies of the St
                    Albans Compilation of the <title>Gesta Alexandri</title> (the other being in Cambridge, Gonville and
                    Caius College MS 154/204) thought to have been written by Ralph Gobion, abbot of St Albans
                    (1146-51). The manuscript also contains the spurious exchange of letters between Alexander the Great
                    and the eastern potentate Dindimus. The volume is one of seven that James speculated may have been
                    donated to the College by Daniel Rogers (see also MSS <ref type="ms" target="CCC206">206</ref>, <ref
                        type="ms" target="CCC221">221</ref>, <ref type="ms" target="CCC229">229</ref>, <ref type="ms"
                        target="CCC231">231</ref> and <ref type="ms" target="CCC239">239</ref>) in addition to the seven
                    that can certainly be traced to that donor (MSS <ref type="ms" target="CCC214">214</ref>, <ref
                        type="ms" target="CCC223">223</ref>, <ref type="ms" target="CCC224">224</ref>, <ref type="ms"
                        target="CCC228">228</ref>, <ref type="ms" target="CCC230">230</ref>, <ref type="ms"
                        target="CCC236">236</ref> and <ref type="ms" target="CCC248">248</ref>). Rogers is presumably to
                    be identified with the scholar, poet, author and diplomat who rose to be clerk to Elizabeth I's
                    Privy Council in 1587 and died in 1591, and who is known to have collected a number of manuscripts
                    of an historical character. A perhaps sixteenth-century note on the last folio of the volume refers
                    to land held in Urswick, Lancashire, by the duke of Suffolk.</p>
