            <div xml:id="CCC386" n="MS 386">
                <p>CCCC MS 386 is prefaced by a printed version of an English translation of the works of Terence
                    (195-159 B.C), which appears to be the only surviving copy of this edition of the text. This is
                    followed by a manuscript collection of fourteenth and fifteenth-century treatises on the various
                    disciplines of written composition and aids to producing texts. These include <title>De
                        metro</title>, a text on metre and scansion, the <title>Synonyma</title>, frequently attributed
                    to John of Garland (d. c. 1272), an incomplete version of Alanus ab Insula (Alain de Lille, c.
                    1128-1203) <title>Liber parabolarum</title>, and a collection of verses. The dating for this last
                    section has been suggested as c. 1475-1500.</p>
