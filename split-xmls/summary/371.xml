            <div xml:id="CCC371" n="MS 371">
                <p>CCCC MS 371 was the personal manuscript of Eadmer of Canterbury OSB (c.1060-c.1124), a monk of Christ
                    Church, and the friend and biographer of Anselm of Canterbury. The manuscript provides the primary
                    witness for most of Eadmer's shorter writings (<title>opuscula</title>), including his major
                    hagiographical works and other letters, hymns and sermons. It also contains the sermons <title>De
                        beatitudine perennis uitae</title> and <title>De ordinatione beati Gregorii</title>, which are
                    reputedly by Anselm of Canterbury OSB (d. 1109), a view which has recently been supported by
                    Hayward.</p>
