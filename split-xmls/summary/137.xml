                <p>CCCC MS 137 is a fourteenth-century manuscript which contains a miscellany of theological and
                    spiritual tracts, some containing rules for the behaviour of monks and novices, suggesting that the
                    compilation was intended for monastic use. The book belonged to the Benedictine cathedral priory of
                    Christ Church, Canterbury, and might be identifiable with a book transferred to Evesham Abbey in the
                    late fourteenth century. The last item, the homily of Origen on the lament of Mary Magdalene at the
                    tomb of Christ, was a text which Chaucer was later to translate into English.</p>
