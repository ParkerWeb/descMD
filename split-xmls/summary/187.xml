            <div xml:id="CCC187" n="MS 187">
                <p>CCCC MS 187 contains the translation by Rufinus (c. 345-410) of Eusebius of Caesarea (c. 260-c. 340),
                        <title>Historia ecclesiastica</title> and was written at the end of the eleventh century or
                    start of the twelfth. It has certain later provenance at the cathedral priory of Christ Church,
                    Canterbury and may have been written there, but since it is not in the typical Christ Church script
                    of this time, it may have been imported from elsewhere in England. At some point in the first
                    quarter of the twelfth century <ref type="ms" target="CCC184">CCCC MS 184</ref> was copied from it
                    either at or for Rochester, incorporating a textual omission from CCCC MS 187. The omission in CCCC
                    MS 187 was rectified at some point in the twelfth century, while the Rochester copy's lacuna
                    remained. This suggests that CCCC MS 187 was compared with another exemplar of the work at
                    Canterbury.</p>
