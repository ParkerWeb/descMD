                <p>CCCC MS 217 is a thirteenth-century miscellany containing sermons, exegetical texts, a partial copy
                    of the <title>Pictor in carmine</title>, and works by Peter the Chanter (d. 1197), Bede, William de
                    Montibus (d. 1213), Geoffrey de Vinsauf (d. after 1200), <title>Tria sunt (Documentum de arte
                        uersificandi)</title>, Petrus Riga (d. 1209), <title>Aurora</title>, and Alexander Nequam OSA
                    (1157-1217), <title>Corrogationes Promethei</title>. Of particular note, the copy of William de
                    Montibus, <title>Speculum poenitentis</title>, is an early and reliable one in terms of that work's
                    textual history. There is a much better version of the text of <title>Pictor in carmine</title> in
                        <ref type="ms" target="CCC300">CCCC MS 300</ref>. The unusual binding of this manuscript, being
                    of velvet, is characteristic of the ‘Old Royal’ library of Henry VIII. As a result of the fragility
                    of this binding it has only been possible to image the exterior and interior of the covers and part
                    of the text pages, ff. 1r-21r, 25r, 209r.</p>
