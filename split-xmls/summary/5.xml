                <p>CCCC MS 5 is the first of a two-volume copy of the <title>Historia aurea</title> of John of Tynemouth
                    (fl. c. 1350), dating from c. 1420-40, the second volume being in <ref type="ms" target="CCC006"
                        >CCCC MS 6</ref>. This manuscript of the <title>Historia</title> contains a history of the world
                    from creation to the death of Vespasian, but also includes a description of the world based on the
                    writings of Marco Polo and the versified <title>Itinerarium Cambriae</title>. CCCC MS 5 was one of
                    several manuscripts (others include CCCC MSS <ref type="ms" target="CCC006">6</ref> and <ref
                        type="ms" target="CCC007">7</ref>, BL MS Lansdowne 375 and Cambridge UL MS Ee.4.20) owned and,
                    in some cases, commissioned by William Wintershill (d. c. 1435) the almoner of the Benedictine Abbey
                    of St Albans in Hertfordshire. An inscription in this manuscript relates how Wintershill donated
                    CCCC MS 5 and its companion, now <ref type="ms" target="CCC006">CCCC MS 6</ref>, to the Abbey at his
                    death.</p>
