            <div xml:id="CCC377" n="MS 377">
                <p>CCCC MS 377 contains three distinct items, seemingly with no connection to each other. The first is a
                    twelfth-century Calendar which James, somewhat elliptically, described as having 'a certain German
                    flavour'. The second item, which makes up the greater part of the manuscript, is a late
                    fourteenth-century collection of English statutes (or material such as writs and letters patent
                    conventionally accorded the status of statutes). To this has been added the third item, a
                    fifteenth-century list of religious who possessed temporalities in the diocese of Ely. Nothing is
                    known of how these disparate texts came to be included in the same codex, or how it came into
                    Parker's possession, if indeed it was not he who combined them from separate codices.</p>
