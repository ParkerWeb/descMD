                <p>CCCC MS 161 is a collection of Saints' Lives which has been dated to c.1200. The provenance of the
                    manuscript has been the subject of some debate; the Cluniac monastery at Faversham, Kent has been
                    identified as the possible place of origin, and it seems that the manuscript was later at
                    Canterbury. The majority of the Lives in the collection are of English or British saints, including
                    Aldhelm, David, Dunstan, Ithamar, Neot, and Swithun, but four Cluniac saints are also included,
                    which supports the connection with Faversham. Faversham is in the diocese of Rochester whose
                    cathedral contained the relics of the rarely mentioned Ithamar. According to Lapidge, many of the
                    vitae are somewhat abbreviated. The frontispiece depicts a bishop, and it has been suggested that
                    this may be St Dunstan.</p>
