                <p>CCCC MS 486 is a small vellum codex copied in the late twelfth or early thirteenth century, said to
                    come from Mt Athos, and evidently meant for monastic use. The contents are a miscellany:
                    Ecclesiasticus (missing the first 8 chapters); a short section on the iambic metre; doctrinal
                    responses by Gregory of Nyssa (c. 330-c. 395), Dionysius of Alexandria (d. c. 264), Nicon, and
                    Peter, patriarch of Antioch as well as some anonymous extracts. The book retains its original
                    medieval binding. As a result of the fragility of this binding it has only been possible to image
                    the exterior and interior of the covers and part of the text pages, ff. 1r-9r.</p>
