                <p>CCCC MS 317 is a compilation of three volumes of religious tracts. The first volume contains the
                    synodal statutes of Eudes de Sully, Bishop of Paris (archbishop 1196-1208, d. 1208) and sermons
                    attributed to Geoffrey Babio du Louroux, archbishop of Bordeaux (archbishop 1135-58, d. 1158). The
                    second volume contains a copy of <title>De uirtutibus et uitiis</title> (chaps. 6-36) by Alcuin (c.
                    735/40-804). The third volume contains commentaries on the Pater Noster, the Ave Maria and the
                    Apostles Creed by John Waldeby (d. after 1372); two pseudo-Augustinian tracts; a tract by John
                    Deverose (d. after 1400); tables of biblical themes and theological concepts and an incomplete copy
                    of <title>Speculum ecclesiae</title> by Edmund of Abingdon (c. 1174-1240), Archbishop of Canterbury
                    (1234-1240), which varies significantly from the Forshaw edition (1973).</p>
