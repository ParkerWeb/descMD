                <p>Parker acquired CCCC MS 347 from Norwich cathedral priory, and it was one of three that the priory
                    had been bequeathed by their former owner, Cardinal Adam Easton OSB (c. 1330-97), that Parker
                    secured (see also <ref type="ms" target="CCC074">CCCC MSS 74</ref> and <ref type="ms"
                        target="CCC180">180</ref>). It contains the 'Almanac' (<title>Tabulae almanac</title>) of
                    Profatius Iudaeus (Jacob ben Machir) (fl. 1288-1301) and other astrological material, a Norwich
                    cathedral priory calendar and the only known surviving fragment of Easton's treatise
                        <title>Expositio quorundam terminorum astrologicorum</title>. It was almost certainly once part
                    of the Cardinal's reputedly extensive personal library. If so, it was probably among the 228 books
                    from that source which arrived in Norwich, packed in six barrels, in 1407, ten years after Easton's
                    death in Rome.</p>
