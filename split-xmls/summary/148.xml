                <p>The single text contained is <title>Memoriale presbyterorum</title>, a treatise on sin, confession
                    and penance, intended as a manual for parish priests. Its author is probably William Doune, writing
                    it in 1337/38 while a member of the household of John Grandisson, bishop of Exeter. The text has
                    been edited and extensively discussed by Haren. Paradoxically, although intended as a text for
                    parish priests, this copy has a press mark suggesting its ownership by the Benedictine monks of
                    Norwich Cathedral Priory. The suggested dating of the book is c. 1350.</p>
