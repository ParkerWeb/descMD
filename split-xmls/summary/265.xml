                <p>This manuscript is a miscellany from Worcester containing extracts from a very large number of texts,
                    mostly relating to ecclesiastical observance and penance. Pp. 1-268 constitute a version of
                    "Wulfstan's Handbook", a compilation made for the use of a confessor, and include an Old English
                    form of confession. This compilation is associated with Wulfstan the homilist (d. 1023), bishop of
                    Worcester and archbishop of York, advisor and legislator for both Æthelred the Unready and Cnut. The
                    bulk of the manuscript is eleventh-century, but it was added to into the twelfth century and beyond.
                    It also contains a twelfth-century copy of Hugh of Fleury OSB (d. 1128/35), <title>Historia
                        ecclesiastica siue Chronicon</title>, here given the attribution to Ivo which is usual in its
                    manuscript transmission. Pp. 551-4, the end flyleaves, are taken from a grand thirteenth-century
                    Pontifical written in high-grade textualis. </p>
