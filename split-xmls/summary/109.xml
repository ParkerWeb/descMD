            <div xml:id="CCC109" n="MS 109">
                <p>Matthew Parker's manuscript collection naturally reflects his interest in Reformation theology and
                    theologians and the religious debates which took place in the sixteenth century. MS 109 is one of
                    the compilations of tracts and letters Parker assembled from his collection. The volume consists of
                    letters written to Matthew Parker and tracts on issues such as clerical marriage, the sacraments and
                    monastic vows. The volume also contains a copy of 'Against the opinions of the Germans' by Henry
                    VIII. The manuscript dates to the sixteenth century.</p>
