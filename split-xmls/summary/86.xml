                <p>This manuscript is a fine twelfth-century copy of Hrabanus Maurus (c. 780-856), Commentary on
                    Matthew. It is one of very few manuscripts in the Parker Library to retain its original binding, a
                    very fine example of its time. As a result of the fragility of this binding it has only been
                    possible to image the exterior and interior of the covers and ff. 1r-4v. The provenance of the
                    manuscript is the Cistercian abbey of Rievaulx, where it was listed in a late twelfth-century
                    catalogue. As with <ref type="ms" target="CCC011">CCCC MS 11</ref>, this manuscript attests to the
                    continued influence of Carolingian scholarship in twelfth-century England.</p>
