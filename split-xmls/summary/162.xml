                <p>CCCC MS 162 is a collection of Old English homiles, written in the early eleventh century. Its
                    spellings, and similiarities with the script and decoration of Oxford, Bodleian Library, MSS Bodley
                    340 and 342 and London, BL MS Royal 6. C. I, suggest that it originated somewhere in the south-east
                    of England, perhaps at Rochester or Canterbury. The texts it contains are mostly by Ælfric, but it
                    also includes some anonymous material, including sermons for Thursday, Friday and Saturday of Holy
                    Week, for which Ælfric refused to provide sermon material. Parker removed some material from <ref
                        type="ms" target="CCC178">CCCC MS 178</ref>, a Worcester book, into MS 162, where it is now pp.
                    139-60. He also added a woodcut of the Crucifixion at the front of the manuscript.</p>
