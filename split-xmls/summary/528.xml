                <p>CCCC 528, made in Germany probably at Elbing in West Prussia, contains a set of sermons for the
                    temporal whose author identifies himself in the prologue as Nicholas Lucas, <hi rend="italic">rector
                        parochialis ecclesiae in ganszhowa</hi> (G?sawa, Poland). The collection is dedicated to
                    Wojciech Jastrz?biec, bishop of Pozna? which dates its composition to 1399-1412. The book has its
                    contemporary cover, but this has been extensively restored in the twentieth century. This volume is
                    part of the Elbing collection, a group of manuscripts associated with the Brigittine convent at
                    Elbing (Elblag, Poland) which was founded in 1458 and deserted in 1521. Almost all the Elbing
                    manuscripts contain the ownership inscription of Mary Pernham, wife of Richard Pernham (d. 1628),
                    Fellow of the college and <hi rend="italic">pastor Anglicus</hi> of St Marien church in Elbing from
                    1618-24. An inscription on the verso of the flyleaf relates to the Brigittine house at Elbing and is
                    dated 1463. This provides indisputable evidence of ownership by the convent.</p>
