                <p>This second volume of the Dover Bible contains the latter part of the Old Testament from the Book of
                    Psalms, and the whole of the New Testament, and these books have historiated or ornamental initials.
                    The artists of this volume are different from the first volume, and their work is best parallelled
                    in North French or Flemish manuscripts of the second quarter of the twelfth century - it is possible
                    that they may indeed have come from the border region of France and Flanders, and this is suggested
                    by characteristic iconography from those parts. Some of their work shows Italo-Byzantine influence,
                    but quite different in appearance to that of the first volume, and characterised by patterned linear
                    folds in the form of 'nested V's'. Figures have large faces with staring eyes and heavy dark
                    eyebrows. The two volumes of the Bible found their way into Matthew Parker's collection after the
                    dissolution of the priory at the Reformation.</p>
