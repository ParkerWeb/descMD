                <p>CCCC MS 249 contains a copy of the Koran, written in Arabic, possibly in the early seventeenth
                    century. This codex was never part of Parker's collection, an inscription instead stating that the
                    volume was donated to the college by Jacob (or James) Hitchcock, described as a 'gentleman of
                    Granchester'. A note in a copy of Parker's Register states that the book was procured with the help
                    of M Dobson, who may be identified with the Isaac Dobson who was a Fellow of Corpus Christi in 1628,
                    vicar of Grantchester in 1644 and who rose to be Cambridge University Librarian before his death in
                    1678.</p>
