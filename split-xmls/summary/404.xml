                <p>CCCC MS 404, dating in part to the early fourteenth century, and in part to c. 1349-89, is a
                    miscellany of prophecy texts brought together by Henry of Kirkstead OSB (c. 1314-after 1378), monk
                    and later prior of the abbey of Bury St Edmunds; he was known formerly as Boston of Bury. The
                    prophecies include those of the Tiburtine Sibyl, Hildegard of Bingen OSB (1098-1179), tracts on the
                    Antichrist, and prophecies relating to the popes and the English kings. The prophecies of the popes,
                    in the early fourteenth-century section, are illustrated by drawings. This text must postdate
                    1304-5. Henry was responsible for the books of the abbey and drew up an inventory of them.</p>
