                <p>CCCC MS 295 reflects Parker's obvious interest in the history of the English church and the See of
                    Canterbury in particular. It contains an incomplete version of the <title>Epistolae</title>
                    (Recension III) of Thomas Becket compiled by Alan of Tewkesbury (d. 1202) together with a few
                    letters of John of Salisbury (c. 1115-80). The manuscript was copied in the early thirteenth
                    century, probably at Christ Church, Canterbury, where it has been identified in the library
                    catalogue drawn up by Henry of Eastry in the early fourteenth century. A curious inscription in a
                    late fifteenth-century hand recording that the book was the property of 'ecclesiam Blavnsom' means
                    that it cannot be certain that Parker acquired this manuscript directly from Christ Church.</p>
