                <p>CCCC MS 32 contains the Gospels of Mark and Luke, and the Pauline Epistles in Latin and English with
                    some commentary. The translation and commentary are a unique Middle English version, dating to the
                    late fourteenth century from the North East Midlands. The volume, dating to c. 1400, was probably
                    composed as a Latin teaching aid and does not appear to be of Lollard derivation. The translation is
                    literal and the original author has added glosses to clarify the resultant awkward English. There
                    are marginal drawings of scenes from the Gospels by an unskilled artist.</p>
