                <p>CCCC MS 480 is a twelfth-century Greek manuscript containing psalms, canticles and some hymns. It
                    must have been in England as early as the thirteenth century, and was evidently much used, with
                    marginal Latin transliterations of some of the psalms, and other notes in a variety of hands, which
                    link it with the circle of Robert Grosseteste (d. 1253). It was believed in Parker's time to have
                    belonged to Theodore of Tarsus, and according to a note on f.1r is in the same hand as Cambridge
                    University Library MS Ff.1.24. It is certainly later, but may possibly have a similar
                    provenance.</p>
