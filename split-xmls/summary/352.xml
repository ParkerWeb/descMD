                <p>CCCC MS 352 contains Boethius (c. 480-c. 524), <title>Arithmetica</title>. It was written in the
                    middle of the tenth century at St Augustine's, Canterbury, in the script known as 'Square
                    minuscule', a Southumbrian English variety of Insular minuscule. It is quite a large format book,
                    elegantly written with large margins, and was probably always intended to contain the glosses which
                    have been added by contemporary and slightly later hands. The manuscript may have had a Welsh
                    exemplar. It has later provenance at St Augustine's, Canterbury and is included in its medieval
                    library catalogue. At some point it has lost its ending.</p>
