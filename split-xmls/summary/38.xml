                <p>CCCC MS 38 is a collection of canonical <title>Tabulae</title> and Gregory IX's
                        <title>Decretals</title>, dating to the early years of the fourteenth century. It was item 1723
                    in the fifteenth-century catalogue of St Augustine's abbey, Canterbury, to which it was donated by
                    Dr Thomas Mankael after his death in c. 1329-31. Mankael was the first monk-student from St
                    Augustine's to graduate as a doctor of theology at Oxford. His personal collection of books,
                    presumably acquired during his time at Oxford in the 1320s, made up 39 entries in the St Augustine's
                    catalogue. CCCC MS 38 bears a donation inscription in which Mankael is named. A similar inscription
                    is found in London, BL MS Lansdowne 359.</p>
