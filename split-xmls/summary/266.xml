                <p>CCCC MS 266 contains Letters 1–127, 131–5, 137–8, 143 of Peter of Blois (d. 1212), and was written in
                    the thirteenth century. It has been designated as one of the manuscripts of the second edition which
                    should be used as a basis for any future critical edition. Some of these letters are of major
                    significance in regard to the controversy between Henry II and Thomas Becket. The MS also includes
                    several other minor works of Peter of Blois, some of which commonly circulated with his Letters. The
                    manuscript contains the distinctive pressmark of the London Carmelites.</p>
