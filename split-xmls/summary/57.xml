                <p>CCCC MS 57 is a witness to the intellectual interests of the Benedictine Reform movement in
                    tenth-century England. It contains a collection of Benedictine texts, including the Rule, and a
                    version of Usuard's <title>Martyrologium</title> with Abingdon additions. It was written in Square
                    minuscule at the end of the tenth century or the start of the eleventh either at Canterbury, since
                    its texts are related to Canterbury manuscripts of similar material, or at Abingdon, where it has
                    certain early provenance. The additions to the Martyrology provide a large number of obits of people
                    connected with the monastery of Abingdon; unfortunately they have been badly damaged by a later
                    binder's trimming. In the eleventh century some damage to the manuscript was repaired by a scribe
                    writing an imitiation of the original Square minuscule script.</p>
