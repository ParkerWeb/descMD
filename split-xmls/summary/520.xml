                <p>CCCC MS 520 is a fourteenth- or fifteenth-century paper manuscript, probably made in Germany, which
                    once belonged to the Brigittine convent of Elbing (Elblag), near Gdansk. The Elbing collection was
                    donated to Corpus Christi College by Richard Pernham (1583?-1628) or by his wife, Mary, whose
                    signature is in many of the books. The contents of MS 520 include the <title>De statu curiae
                        Romanae</title> by Henry of Würzburg (d. 1265), and <title>Aurora</title> by Petrus Riga (d.
                    1209), a versified version of the Bible, although in the manuscript this is mistakenly attributed to
                    Peter of Corbeil (c. 1150-1222). The final text contains extracts from the <title>Historia
                        scholastica</title> of Petrus Comestor (d. c. 1187). The manuscript also contains some notes in
                    German on the foundation of religious orders.</p>
