                <p>CCCC MS 510 is part of the Elbing Collection brought back from the abandoned Brigittine monastery at
                    what is now Elblag, near Gdansk in Poland by Richard Pernham (1583?-1628) in the early 1620s and
                    donated to Corpus Christi either by himself or by his wife Mary, whose name is inscribed in many
                    books of the collection. This manuscript, written in Germany in a number of hands in the late
                    fourteenth century, is a collection of tracts, mostly on the Eucharist, including <title>Sermones de
                        corpore Christi</title> attributed to Thomas Aquinas OP (c. 1225-74), excerpts from Bernardus de
                    Parentinis OP (fl. early 14th century), <title>Tractatus de officio missae</title> (<title>Lilium
                        missae</title>) and John of Hildesheim OCarm (d. 1375) <title>Historia trium regum</title>, this
                    last also in CCCC MSS <ref type="ms" target="CCC179">179</ref> and <ref type="ms" target="CCC275"
                        >275</ref>. The <title>Sermones</title> has a colophon saying that it was made by a scribe Paul
                    in Mergenvelt (probably Mergenfeld or Marienfeld) in 1398.</p>
