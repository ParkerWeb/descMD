                <p>CCCC MS 292 is another codex that reflects Matthew Parker's interest in acquiring and preserving
                    manuscripts containing medieval historical texts. This codex contains thirteenth-century copies of
                    the <title>Historia regum Britanniae</title> (including Book VII, the <title>Prophetia Ambrosii
                        Merlini</title>) by Geoffrey of Monmouth (d. 1154), and the <title>History of Charlemagne and
                        Roland</title> by the pseudo-Turpinus, probably written in the second quarter of the twelfth
                    century. Both texts have had lacunae supplemented in a sixteenth-century hand. In addition, this
                    manuscript preserves a number of fourteenth- and sixteenth-century copies of documents relating to
                    Edward I's claims to the overlordship of Scotland, some of which were transcribed into <ref
                        type="ms" target="CCC101">CCCC MS 101</ref>.</p>
