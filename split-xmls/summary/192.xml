                <p>This manuscript contains a copy of the <title>Liber officialis</title> of Amalarius of Metz (d. c.
                    850), written in Brittany, at the monastery of Landévennec, in the year 952. We can identify the
                    year the manuscript was written on account of a scribal colophon, in fact the work of two scribes,
                    on f. 97v, which contains detailed chronological information from a paschal table. The colophon also
                    tells us that 'Amadeus, deacon and monk, ordered this little book to be written'. The manuscript
                    includes many interlinear glosses, some of them in Breton, which were published by Whitley Stokes.
                    At some point before the thirteenth century the manuscript arrived in England, where it has a
                    provenance at the cathedral priory of Christ Church, Canterbury.</p>
