                <p>CCCC MS 448 is a tenth-century manuscript, probably from Worcester, with later provenance at
                    Winchester. It illustrates the way in which Parker made use of his collections to argue some of his
                    strongly-held beliefs. Among other texts it contains a poem from a certain Prosper to his wife;
                    Parker identified this Prosper with a bishop of that name, and therefore took it as evidence for
                    married bishops in the late antique or early medieval church. He had the text printed with a
                    translation, and this is now bound into the manuscript after f. 40, where it seems to be the unique
                    surviving copy. Parker married his wife, Margaret, before it became legal for priests to marry in
                    England; there is a story that they had both long before vowed never to marry another. They had a
                    happy and fruitful marriage, and Parker never recovered from her death in 1570, five years before
                    his.</p>
