                <p>The author of this manual of theology, <title>Compendium ueritatis theologicae</title>, contained in
                    CCCC MS 64, dating to the early fifteenth century, is now known to be the Dominican, Hugo Ripelinus
                    of Strasbourg (c. 1200-68). It was part of the medieval library of the college, given by Thomas
                    Markaunt in 1439. The book was very popular in the late Middle Ages and was translated into
                    vernacular languages such as German, but never into Middle English, although many Latin copies
                    survive in English libraries. It is divided into seven books dealing with central issues of theology
                    such as the natures of God and Christ, sin and virtue, the sacraments and the last things.</p>
