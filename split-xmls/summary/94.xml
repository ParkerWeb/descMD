                <p>CCCC MS 94 contains an expanded version of the decretal collection of Ivo of Chartres (c. 1040-1116),
                        <title>Panormia</title>, known as the <title>Collectio decem partium</title> and sometimes
                    attributed to Hildebert of Lavardin (1056-1133). The manuscript was written in Canterbury in the
                    mid-twelfth century, though authorities disagree as to whether it was produced at the Benedictine
                    abbey of St Augustine, or the Benedictine cathedral priory of the Holy Trinity, Christ Church. The
                    hand of the same scribe that produced this codex has been identified in CUL MS Kk.1.17, Oxford,
                    Bodleian MS e Mus. 66 and CCCC MSS <ref type="ms" target="CCC270">270</ref> and <ref type="ms"
                        target="CCC274">274</ref>. In the eighteenth century Nasmith recorded a fragment of a homily
                    written in uncial script as being present with the codex, but this had disappeared by the time that
                    M. R. James examined the volume. It has never been rediscovered.</p>
