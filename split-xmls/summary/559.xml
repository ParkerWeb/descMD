                <p>CCCC MS 559 is a collection of legal material, mostly witness depositions, collected in the later
                    fifteenth century by Pierre Assailly, an official of the Châtelet in Paris and probably copied c.
                    1480, although containing some material dating originally to the thirteenth century. The 32 leaves
                    that make up this manuscript were removed from Parker's copy of the 1497 edition of the Letters of
                    Pope Pius II printed in Lyons (now SP.16 in the Parker Library) during conservation of that volume
                    in 1952.</p>
