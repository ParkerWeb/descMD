            <div xml:id="CCC193" n="MS 193">
                <p>CCCC MS 193 was written at the end of the eighth century at a centre which wrote the Corbie "ab" type
                    of pre-Caroline minuscule, perhaps Saint Médard, Soissons, where it seems to have early provenance.
                    It contains one of the oldest surviving copies of Ambrose's <title>Hexameron</title>, a commentary
                    on the six days of creation containing much interesting scientific knowledge. It is not clear when
                    it came to England, but it may have arrived in the eleventh century. In 1903 James tentatively
                    suggested it might be identifiable with an entry in Eastry's catalogue of the library of the
                    cathedral priory of Christ Church, Canterbury, but he later abandoned this identification.</p>
