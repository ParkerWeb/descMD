                <p>CCCC MS 521, made in Germany, is part of the Elbing Collection brought back from the abandoned
                    Brigittine monastery at what is now Elblag in Poland by Richard Pernham (1583?-1628) in the early
                    1620s and donated to Corpus Christi either by himself or by his wife Mary, whose name is inscribed
                    in many books of the collection. Scribal colophons allow the two volumes that make of this codex to
                    be precisely dated to 1424-5 and 1388 respectively. The first volume, of 1424-5, contains a number
                    of tracts relating to prophecy, including the earliest version of the <title>Onus mundi</title> by
                    Johannes Tortsch (c. 1400-45), and Richard of Saint-Victor OSA (d. 1173), <title>De meditandis
                        plagis quae circa finem mundi euenient</title>. Also in this part are extracts from the
                        <title>Vitae Patrum</title> (<title>Vitas Patrum</title>, a compilation of lives of early monk
                    and hermit saints), the <title>Revelations</title> of the pseudo-Methodius, and at the end, of local
                    significance, the synodal statutes of the Henry III, Bishop of Varmia (1373-1401), formerly in East
                    Prussia but now in Poland (Warmia). The second, earlier, volume, contains a glossed hymnal, with a
                    colophon dating its completion to 1388, and a tract on events portending the coming of plague.</p>
