                <p>CCCC MS 139 is one of the most important post-Conquest chronicle manuscripts in the Parker Library.
                    It contains a unique version of the <title>Historia regum</title> by Simeon of Durham OSB (fl. c.
                    1090-c. 1128) and its <title>Continuation</title> by John of Hexham OSA (d. before 1209), together
                    with a number of other important texts relevant to the history of Durham, northern England and
                    Scotland. Its production has variously been ascribed to the religious houses of Fountains, Hexham,
                    Sawley and Durham, though by the sixteenth century it was almost certainly at Westminster Abbey,
                    where it was seen by the historian John Bale (1495-1563).</p>
