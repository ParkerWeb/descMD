                <p>CCCC MS 535 is a German manuscript which contains a dictionary called <title>Brachylogus</title> by
                    the Dutch lexicographer, Johannes de Mera (fl. c. 1350). The dating of this manuscript is to the
                    last quarter of the fourteenth century. At the end of the text it is noted that the
                        <title>Brachylogus</title> was completed in 1354 in Mechelen. The book is decorated with many
                    fine large coloured ornamental initials. This volume is part of the Elbing collection; a group of
                    manuscripts which belonged to a Brigittine convent at Elbing (Elblag), near Gdansk. The collection
                    was donated to Corpus Christi College by either Richard Pernham (1583?-1628) or his wife Mary, whose
                    name is inscribed in many of these books.</p>
