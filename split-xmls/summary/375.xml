                <p>CCCC MS 375 is a compilation of verse made at St Albans Abbey in the middle of the twelfth century,
                    probably for immediate presentation to Christ Church, Canterbury as a gift. It was certainly at
                    Christ Church by the early fourteenth century, when it was included in Henry of Eastry's library
                    catalogue. The flyleaf on which the classmark was recorded became detached from the rest of this
                    manuscript, and is still at Canterbury Cathedral, classmark SB B 232 final page. The main contents
                    of the manuscript are metrical saints' lives of Katherine and Ælfheah (Alphege), both written by an
                    unidentified Richard, presumably a monk of St Albans. Their composition has been associated with
                    Abbot Geoffrey de Gorron (abbot 1119-46), who is known to have been devoted to St Katherine.</p>
