                <p>CCCC MS 438 contains two quite distinct types of text. In the first category is a thirteenth-century
                    copy of the medical treatise <title>De uiribus herbarum</title> attributed variously to Odo of Meung
                    (fl. last third of eleventh century), once considered to be by the Roman poet Aemilius Macer. The
                    rest of the manuscript is taken up with material relating to the history of England and of
                    Canterbury in particular. Thus one finds in this codex thirteenth-century copies of the <title>Gesta
                        regum</title> and <title>Actus pontificum Cantuariensis ecclesiae</title> of Gervase of
                    Canterbury OSB (d. 1210), a fifteenth-century transcript of clerical taxation records and a copy of
                    the bull of 1170 authorising the canonization of Anselm of Canterbury. The contents and other notes
                    strongly support a provenance at the Benedictine cathedral priory of the Holy Trinity, Christ
                    Church, Canterbury.</p>
