            <div xml:id="CCC374" n="MS 374">
                <p>CCCC MS 374 is a small manuscript that contains an epitome of the Brut chronicle down to 1429 written
                    in an early sixteenth-century hand, and the <title>Manipulus chronicorum</title>, a description and
                    history of England said to have been drawn from 'multa et uariis autoribus' and written somewhat
                    earlier than the <title>Brut</title>. The presence of the letters 'TW' in Parker's characteristic
                    red chalk has been taken to mean that the volume came to Parker via either John Twyne (1507-81) or
                    Thomas Wotton (1521-87) and, therefore, probably from Canterbury - possibly St Augustine's. However,
                    the most recent survey of the library of St Augustine's agrees with Neil Ker's earlier rejection of
                    this provenance.</p>
