                <p>CCCC MS 320 consists of two volumes, probably joined by Matthew Parker, who often had otherwise
                    unrelated material bound together. The first volume contains sermons by Geoffrey Babio du Louroux,
                    archbishop of Bordeaux (1135-58), and others, copied in the twelfth century. The second is an
                    Anglo-Saxon Penitential. It contains two Penitential texts and some related material, including the
                        <title>Libellus responsionum</title> found in Bede's <title>Historia ecclesiastica</title> in
                    which Augustine of Canterbury and Gregory the Great correspond about the requirements of moral
                    behaviour for the newly converted Anglo-Saxons. There are also some miscellaneous notes on things
                    like the length of the Ark, and some added Old English material. T. A. M. Bishop linked this
                    manuscript into a network of material written at St Augustine's, Canterbury in the second half of
                    the tenth century or later.</p>
