                <p>CCCC MS 35 is one of the most important among the early manuscripts of the '<title>Opuscula</title>'
                    of Thomas Aquinas OP, and has been used for collation with other manuscripts in editions of these
                    texts in the <title>Opera omnia</title> of St Thomas. The '<title>Opuscula</title>' are relatively
                    short theological tracts which were separate from his large-scale works. The dating of the MS is
                    late thirteenth or early fourteenth century, but the provenance is uncertain. M. R. James considered
                    the scribe to be English, but the decoration may be either English or French, perhaps most likely
                    English in a very French-influenced manner.</p>
