                <p>CCCC MS 353 contains a fourteenth-century copy of the <title>Summa dictaminis</title> of Petrus de
                    Vinea (d. 1249). The <title>Summa</title>, a collection of de Vinea's letters, are broadly concerned
                    with the art of politics and, in particular, the relations between the emperor and the papacy in the
                    early and mid-thirteenth century. No doubt this was what attracted Parker to the manuscript,
                    concerned as he was with the relationship between church and state. A donation inscription records
                    that the book was given to the church at Burton by William de Swepston, possibly (though not
                    certainly) indicating that this volume was once at the Benedictine abbey of the Blessed Virgin and
                    St Modwenna at Burton on Trent.</p>
