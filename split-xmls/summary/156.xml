                <p>The miscellany of twenty-four texts in CCCC MS 156 was originally in four separate volumes of
                    differing dates The first is a printed book of the sixteenth century containing the Collations of
                    John Cassian (c. 360-430/35). The other three sections date variously to c. 1400-1450 and c.
                    1425-1475. Several of the texts are Franciscan and Dominican and perhaps these three sections were
                    compiled for the use of mendicants. They include works on indulgences and confession by François de
                    Meyronnes OFM, Richard FitzRalph (d. 1360) and Richard of Saint-Victor OSA (d. 1173), and letters
                    and sermons by Robert Grossesteste (d. 1253).</p>
