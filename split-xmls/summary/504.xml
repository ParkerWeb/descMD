                <p>CCCC MS 504 is a fourteenth-century manuscript in two parts written probably in Prague c. 1375-80.
                    The first contains a long word list. The second part, dated by a colophon to 1378, contains the
                        <title>Liber deriuationum</title>, a dictionary attributed to the grammarian and canon lawyer,
                    Hugutio of Pisa (c. 1140/50-1210). Hugutio's <title>Deriuationes</title>, as it is sometimes called,
                    was one of the most popular books of its type in the late Middle Ages, particularly in schools. The
                    book has a contemporary binding with latch plates and traces of chain marks. This volume is part of
                    the Elbing collection; a group of manuscripts which belonged to a Brigittine convent at Elbing
                    (Elblag), near Gdansk. The collection was donated to Corpus Christi College by Richard Pernham
                    (1583?-1628) or his wife, Mary, whose signature is in several of the books.</p>
