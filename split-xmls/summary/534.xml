                <p>CCCC 534 contains a collection of late fourteenth-century material, principally sermons, which can be
                    associated with Charles University in Prague. It includes on ff. 148r-237v a collection of sermons
                    and speeches given at the law faculty of the university c. 1377-93, including recommendations of
                    rectors and graduation speeches. An identical collection of material is found in Prague,
                    Metropolitan Chapter Library MS E.83. Other texts in the volume include Willelmus Peraldus OP (c.
                    1200-71), <title>Summa de uitiis</title>, an important penitential text written in the middle years
                    of the thirteenth century, and the Pseudo-Bernard of Clairvaux, <title>Speculum peccatoris</title>.
                    The book retains its original binding but it was extensively restored in the twentieth century. This
                    volume is part of the Elbing collection, a group of manuscripts associated with the Brigittine
                    convent at Elbing (Elblag), near Gdansk which was founded in 1458 and deserted in 1521. Almost all
                    the Elbing manuscripts contain the ownership inscription of Mary Pernham, wife of Richard Pernham
                    (d. 1628), Fellow of the college and <hi rend="italic">pastor Anglicus</hi> of St Marien church in
                    Elbing from 1618-24.</p>
