                <p>CCCC MS 546 is a paper genealogical roll made by Ambrose Middelton of the Inner Temple, London, in
                    1527, and given to Corpus by Thomas Whincop, fellow, in 1692. In its seventeen feet of length it
                    traces the history of the world from Adam, via Noah and other Biblical figures, through such
                    legendary early kings as Lud and Arthur, down to the Anglo-Saxon kings. It concludes with Harold II,
                    and his death in the Norman Conquest of 1066. It is written in English, in a crabbed secretary hand.
                    Presumably it was copied from a medieval roll; however, usually such a genealogy would extend beyond
                    the Norman Conquest, so it is interesting that Ambrose Middelton chose to conclude at this
                    point.</p>
