                <p>CCCC MS 68 is a compilation of texts, several relating to liturgical matters, written by a certain
                    Tielmann, son of Clerward, cleric of Utrecht, for Walter Crome, fellow of Gonville Hall, in 1432. In
                    the same year Tielmann also wrote for Crome MS 114/183 in Gonville and Caius College. This Tielmann
                    is not the same as the one who wrote some manuscripts now in Balliol College, Oxford. The manuscript
                    was given to Cambridge University Library by Crome in 1444 and was there in 1473. In 1567 Andrew
                    Perne, Master of Peterhouse and several times Vice-Chancellor of the University, gave it to Matthew
                    Parker, and it came to Corpus with his collection in 1575. Another part of the same manuscript, now
                    Cambridge, King's College, MS 9, was detached before Parker acquired MS 68. Among the texts included
                    are Isidore of Seville (c. 560-636), <title>De ecclesiasticis officiis</title>, and William of
                    Malmesbury OSB (c. 1080-1143), <title>Abbreviatio Amalarii</title>, an abbreviation of the work of
                    Amalarius of Metz (c. 775/80-c. 850), <title>De ecclesiasticis officiis</title>.</p>
