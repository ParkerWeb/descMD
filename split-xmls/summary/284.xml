                <p>The main text in CCCC MS 284, dating to c. 1400-25, is the Prayers and Meditations of Anselm of
                    Canterbury OSB (d. 1109), decorated with fine illuminated initials. The remainder of the book
                    consists of a miscellany of liturgical texts: Office of the Dead, Penitential and Gradual psalms, a
                    Sarum litany, an unidentified Benedictine litany and a litany of the abbey of St Augustine's,
                    Canterbury. The book cannot be identified in the library catalogue of the abbey, and the presence of
                    its litany, given the disparate liturgical content, is not sufficient to provide any firm evidence
                    that it belonged to St Augustine's.</p>
