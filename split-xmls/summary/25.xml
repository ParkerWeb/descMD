                <p>This manuscript comprises a collection of letters and tracts attributed to Cyprian (d. 258). However,
                    the attribution of some of these texts is spurious; for example, the <title>De aleatoribus</title>,
                    though undoubtedly an early text, has also been attributed to a number of other authors, including
                    Popes Victor I and Callixtus I. CCCC MS 25 is a fourteenth-century copy of the twelfth-century
                    Buildwas manuscript, Cambridge, Pembroke College, MS 154, and the marginalia of the latter
                    manuscript has been incorporated into the former.</p>
