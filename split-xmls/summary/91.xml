            <div xml:id="CCC091" n="MS 91">
                <p>CCCC MS 91 contains one of only two surviving copies of the long version of the fifteenth-century
                    French romance of <title>Histoire des Seigneurs de Gavres</title> (the other being in Brussels,
                    Bibliothèque Royale MS 10238). <title>Histoire</title> was probably composed in Flanders in the
                    1450s, and the Corpus version is illustrated c. 1470-80 with a large frontispiece miniature by an
                    anonymous Flemish artist who is known to have worked on a number of other volumes for patrons with
                    connections to Edward IV. The artist has been named the Master of the Harley Froissart. This has led
                    to speculation that this manuscript may have been produced for Edward IV or possibly William, Lord
                    Hastings, c. 1475. Whoever the patron was, he was a Knight of the Garter, as evidenced by the garter
                    surrounding the now erased blank shield on f. 1r. How the codex came into Parker's possession is
                    unknown.</p>
