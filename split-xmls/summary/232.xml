                <p>MS 232 contains documents relating to Thomas Markaunt and his donation of books to Corpus Christi
                    College, including his will of 1439, the Master's acceptance of the bequest, a register of the books
                    and a list of the keepers of Markaunt's bequest. It also contains lists of books given to the
                    College in 1458 by M. Tyttleshale and other books in the College Library up to 1516. The opening 11
                    folios of the manuscript are vellum and date to c. 1440 but the rest of the manuscript is on paper
                    and dates to the early years of the following century.</p>
