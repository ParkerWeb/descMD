                <p>CCCC MS 449 is a manuscript of the <title>Glossary</title> and <title>Grammar</title> by Ælfric of
                    Eynsham OSB (d. 1010). The original eleventh-century portion was obviously badly incomplete by the
                    time Parker acquired it, and he had the missing parts of the text supplied by one of his own
                    scribes. Ælfric's <title>Grammar</title> was one of the first instructional texts on Latin to be
                    written in a vernacular; as such it was extremely useful for early modern scholars who could use the
                    Latin material to learn Old English.</p>
