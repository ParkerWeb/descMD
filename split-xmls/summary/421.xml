                <p>CCCC MS 421 is an important collection of Old English homilies, many by Ælfric of Eynsham OSB (d.
                    1010). It originated in the first half of the eleventh century as a companion volume to <ref
                        type="ms" target="CCC419">CCCC MS 419</ref>, partly written by the same scribe, and pp. 1–2 of
                    MS 421 were originally physically part <ref type="ms" target="CCC419">CCCC MS 419</ref>. Substantial
                    additions were made to MS 421 at at Exeter in the time of Bishop Leofric (1050-1072). The manuscript
                    contains an eleventh-century frontispiece drawing of the Crucifixion in the part (p. 1) which was
                    originally in <ref type="ms" target="CCC419">CCCC MS 419</ref>. MS 421 was Parker's sixth volume of
                    homilies in his numeration system.</p>
