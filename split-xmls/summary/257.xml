                <p>CCCC MS 257, dating to the last quarter of the fourteenth century, contains four texts by Robert
                    Grosseteste (d. 1253) who was Bishop of Lincoln from 1235 until his death. The first two are
                    essentially part of the same work, the <title>Dicta</title>, a collection of selected texts from his
                    sermons and lectures. In this manuscript the <title>Dicta</title> are preceded by a detailed table
                    of contents. The other two texts are on confession and pastoral matters, and are among Grosseteste's
                    extensive writings on pastoral care and the teachings of the Church. These are an example of an
                    important genre of literature which followed the Fourth Lateran Council of 1215's recommendations
                    for the reform of teaching the laity on the doctrines of the Church.</p>
