                <p>CCCC MS 49 is an English Bible which has been dated to c. 1270-80. Most English thirteenth-century
                    Bibles are somewhat larger than contemporary Parisian Bibles, as in the case of this manuscript, and
                    relatively few were made in comparison with the very large numbers from Paris. Each book of the
                    Bible has an historiated initial. The manuscript belonged to St Augustine's abbey, and its
                    illumination is related to a Psalter (Oxford, Corpus Christi College MS 285) connected with Christ
                    Church, Canterbury. Another Bible (Oxford, Merton College MS 235) is also related in the style of
                    its illumination and was probably painted by the same artists. In view of the connections with St
                    Augustine's and Christ Church it is possible that the book was written and decorated in
                    Canterbury.</p>
