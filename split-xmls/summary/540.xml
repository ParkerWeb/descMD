                <p>This Book of Hours, CCCC MS 540, of c. 1390-1400, was given to Corpus Christi College by Lord
                    Queenborough (1861-1949) in 1923. It was made in Avignon and is decorated by the same group of
                    artists as three other Books of Hours, Paris, BnF MS lat. 10527, Vienna, Österreichische
                    Nationalbibliothek MS ser. nov. 9450, and New York, Public Library MS Spencer 49. It contains eight
                    half-page miniatures and many decorative ornamental borders. One of the artists involved in the
                    illumination may be Jean de Toulouse, documented as working in Avignon 1378-94. A note in the
                    calendar records the anniversary of the building of the castle of Cordes-sur-Ciel, near Albi, and
                    the owner very likely lived in that region.</p>
