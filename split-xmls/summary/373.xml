            <div xml:id="CCC373" n="MS 373">
                <p>CCCC MS 373 was once thought to contain a copy of Ekkehard of Aura (fl. early twelfth century),
                        <title>Imperial Chronicle</title>, a history of the Franks, ancestors of the Emperor Henry V at
                    whose request it was written. However, it is now known that the manuscript is the unique copy of an
                    anonymous chronicle, closely modelled on Ekkehard's work, but also incorporating material from the
                        <title>World Chronicle</title> (ending c.1111) of Sigebert of Gembloux (c. 1029/9-1112),
                    continued down to 1114, shortly after which date this copy was produced in Germany. It seems to be
                    by an anonymous author working in Wurzburg 1112-13. The book is illustrated by pen drawings in brown
                    and red of the enthroned kings and emperors. Recent research has suggested that the codex may have
                    been donated to the monastery at Bec by the Empress Matilda (c. 1102-67), from where it travelled to
                    Rochester, possibly being lent for copying in the late twelfth century. It may be identified with
                    the volume described as <title>Cronica Francorum i volumen</title> in Rochester library's catalogue
                    of 1202, and if so it was presumably from there that it found its way, together with many other
                    former monastic manuscripts, into Parker's collection.</p>
