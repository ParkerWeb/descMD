                <p>MS 108, contains a large collection of documents and letters collected by Matthew Parker (1504-1575).
                    His diverse career included serving as the dean of Stoke by Clare College; as one of Anne Boleyn's
                    chaplains and, after her fall, as one of the king's chaplains; as dean of Lincoln and prebend of
                    Corringham in Lincoln Cathedral, as master of Corpus Christi College and Vice-Chancellor of the
                    University of Cambridge; and as archbishop of Canterbury. Just as this broad career is reflected
                    across the Parker Library collection as a whole, much of it is reflected here in a microcosm of
                    letters and documents relating to Stoke by Clare College, Lincoln cathedral, Cambridge and the
                    government of England. This manuscript also contains a copy of the 'Report on the conditions of
                    Cambridge' which Parker and others compiled when the Chantries Act of December 1545 threatened the
                    University of Cambridge's financial security. The manuscript dates to the sixteenth century.</p>
