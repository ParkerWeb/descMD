                <p>CCCC MS 228 contains works by the poet Claudian (d. c. 404) and the philosopher and poet Bernardus
                    Silvestris (d. c. 1178). This thirteenth-century manuscript includes a very good copy of Claudian's
                        <title>De raptu Proserpinae</title>, although the text breaks off abruptly in the final book,
                    leading J. B. Hall to suggest in his edition that one or two folia have been lost from the
                    manuscript. The manuscript also contains a copy of <title>Megacosmos</title>, part of the
                        <title>Cosmographia</title>, a Platonic allegorical work by Bernardus Silvestris. The manuscript
                    was donated to Corpus Christi College by Daniel Rogers and may have had earlier connections with
                    Beauvais.</p>
