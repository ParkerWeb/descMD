                <p>CCCC MS 561 contains a single letter from Matthew Parker to William Cecil dated March 1559 and
                    discussing the state of Cambridge University. The letter was not part of the large collection of
                    Parker's correspondence as found in the college (see in particular <ref type="MS" target="CCC114A"
                        >CCCC MS 114A</ref> and <ref type="MS" target="CCC114B">114B</ref>), but was instead purchased
                    at auction in 1942. The letter is accompanied by a transcription of the letter made by E. H. Minns,
                    Librarian of Pembroke College, Cambridge in the year of its acquisition.</p>
