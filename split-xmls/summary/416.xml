            <div xml:id="CCC416" n="MS 416">
                <p>CCCC MS 416 is a twelfth-century manuscript which has a roughly contemporary contents list showing
                    that it once contained a large number of works. However, all of these are now lost except for the
                        <title>Liber officialis</title> of Amalarius of Metz (c. 780-850), a text explaining the liturgy
                    of the mass and divine office. The standard Ely cathedral priory press mark can be found in the
                    margin of f. 1 recto (see also <ref type="ms" target="CCC044">CCCC MS 44</ref>). The flyleaf
                    explains that it was given, presumably to Ely, by one William Stradesete. It later came into the
                    possession of Matthew Parker.</p>
