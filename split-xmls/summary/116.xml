            <div xml:id="CCC116" n="MS 116">
                <p>CCCC MS 116 is the third genealogical roll now in the Parker Library collection; the others are MSS
                        <ref type="ms" target="CCC098">98</ref> and <ref type="ms" target="CCC098A">98A</ref>.
                    Originally written c. 1469-1470, the membrane side contains a genealogy of the English kings from
                    Adam to Edward IV (d. 1483), though with a number of later additions. The dorse contains a list of
                    popes from St Peter to Benedict XII (1334-42) and of emperors from Tiberius to Frederick II (d.
                    1250). More profusely illustrated with tinted drawings of persons in the genealogy than the other
                    two rolls in the collection, it was, however, not part of Parker's bequest to the college but was
                    given by Dr Thomas Whincop (fellow 1670-1682, d. 1713) in 1682-1683.</p>
