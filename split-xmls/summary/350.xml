            <div xml:id="CCC350" n="MS 350">
                <p>CCCC MS 350 contains one of only two copies known to be extant of the <title>Historia maior de
                        fundatione ecclesiae Wintoniensis</title> by Thomas Rudbourne OSB (d. c. 1450), monk of
                    Winchester. The other copy, Lambeth Palace Library MS 183, is an incomplete late fifteenth-century
                    version of the text from which the edition in the Corpus manuscript is a direct copy made in the
                    sixteenth century, possibly (though not certainly) for Parker. As such, CCCC MS 350 should probably
                    join other Corpus manuscripts such as <ref type="ms" target="CCC056">56</ref>, <ref type="ms"
                        target="CCC342">342</ref> and <ref type="ms" target="CCC348">348</ref> as evidence for Parker's
                    concern not simply to acquire existing manuscripts that contained material he regarded as
                    interesting or useful, but also to make copies of them to ensure their survival.</p>
