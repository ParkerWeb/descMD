            <div xml:id="CCC132" n="MS 132">
                <p>CCCC MS 132 is a sixteenth-century volume (1525) describing the work of those commissioners charged
                    with attempting to secure the dowry of Mary Tudor, daughter of Henry VII, from her marriage to Louis
                    XII of France in 1514, cut short by his death in 1515, after which she married Charles Brandon, duke
                    of Suffolk. It seems to have been little used by scholars of her life, who have preferred to employ
                    information from the formal governmental records in both English and French archives. The end
                    flyleaves are a record from an earlier manuscript concerning the distribution of wine in the royal
                    household, and must date from the reign of Henry IV.</p>
