                <p>Still in its original binding, CCCC MS 218, dating to the period c. 1354-75, contains the <title>Le
                        livre des seintes medicines</title> of Henry of Grosmont (c. 1310-61), first duke of Lancaster.
                    This is one of three extant copies, the other two being in Stonyhurst College 24, and Aberystwyth,
                    NLW Peniarth 388.2. It is a devotional text containing an allegory in which the sickness of the body
                    is parallelled with the sickness of the soul. Christ, as the doctor, heals the five senses from
                    infection by the seven deadly sins. The book is of particular importance to the College because
                    Henry of Lancaster played an important role in its foundation in the middle years of the fourteenth
                    century and is commemorated as one of its great benefactors.</p>
