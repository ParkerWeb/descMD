                <p>CCCC MS 269 is one of three manuscripts that contains the 'A' recension of the <title>Collectio
                        canonum</title> of Anselm of Lucca (written c. 1083-86) (the others being Paris, Bibliothèque
                    nationale de France MS lat. 12519 and Biblioteca Apostolica Vaticana MS lat. 1363), and the only one
                    with a known English provenance. Originally dating from the twelfth century, a fifteenth-century
                    inscription records that this volume was then in the library of the Cistercian abbey of the Blessed
                    Virgin Mary at Pipewell in Northamptonshire. If it was still at Pipewell at the time of the abbey's
                    dissolution in 1538, it was fortunate to survive the looting that followed that event. Perhaps it
                    was removed together with the other fixtures and fittings of the abbey that were granted to Sir
                    William Parr, brother of Katherine Parr, Henry VIII's last wife.</p>
