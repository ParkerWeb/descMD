                <p>CCCC MS 369 contains a miscellany of historical texts, including genealogies of the English kings,
                    the earls of Chester and the Hastangs family and lists of castles and religious houses in Britain
                    copied at various times in the fourteenth, early fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. The most
                    substantial text in this slim volume is a chronicle from the arrival of the Saxons to the reign of
                    Henry III with continuations in various hands down to 1337. This section can probably be dated c.
                    1425. The basis of the chronicle in this manuscript was identified by Hardy in the late nineteenth
                    century as being a work by John Bever (d. c. 1311) known as the <title>Brutus abbreuiato</title>.
                    The provenance of this manuscript is uncertain, with Ker demurring from James' belief that it may
                    have been from Lichfield.</p>
