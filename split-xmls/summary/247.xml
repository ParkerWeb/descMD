                <p>CCCC MS 247 contains a thirteenth-century copy of a manual of canon law for confessors called
                        <title>Summa de casibus poenitentiae</title> (or <title>Summa de poenitentia</title>), a work
                    which greatly influenced the further development of the sacrament of penance. The tract was written
                    by Raymond of Peñafort OP (c. 1190-1275), who was a member (and briefly Master) of the Dominican
                    order and a very influential canon lawyer. The <title>Summa</title> was very widely read and
                    numerous manuscript copies exist from the last three centuries of the Middle Ages.</p>
