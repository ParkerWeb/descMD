                <p>CCCC MS 363 contains a late fifteenth- or early sixteenth-century copy of the <title>Historia
                        Brittonum</title> commonly attributed to the figure known as Nennius. The text was described in
                    error in a later sixteenth-century note as the work of Gildas (sixth century), and this is how it
                    remains described in M. R. James' catalogue, though James himself was aware of the misattribution
                    and noted it in his description of the manuscript.</p>
