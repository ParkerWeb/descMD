                <p>This manuscript contains an exceptionally beautiful copy of <title>Kalila wa Dimna</title>, the
                    eighth-century Arabic text by Abdu’llah ibn al-Mugaffa. Ibn al-Mugaffa’s work was based on a
                    third-century Sanskrit <title>speculum principis</title> text, which was transmitted to the Arab
                    world by way of an intermediary sixth-century Persian translation. <title>Kalila wa Dimna</title>
                    contains a series of instructive animal fables, which might be compared to Aesop’s Fables in the
                    Greek tradition. CCCC MS 578 is a fourteenth-century manuscript, in a very fine hand, with superb
                    illustrations characteristic of the Baghdad school. The manuscript was given to Corpus Christi
                    College by W. T. Sandiford in 1796.</p>
