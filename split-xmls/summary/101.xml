                <p>CCCC MS 101 is a collection of sixteenth-century transcripts made for Parker from manuscripts within
                    his own collection and elsewhere. The broad emphasis of the material is historical in nature, with a
                    particular interest in the history of ecclesiastical jurisdiction and relations between the crown
                    and the episcopacy. The source material ranges in date from pre-Conquest material to Henry VI's
                    injunction preventing papal legates from entering England without licence. As such this manuscript
                    is a revealing insight into why Parker collected the material that he did, since it is clear that
                    such matters were highly relevant to Parker's campaign to establish the Elizabethan reformation on
                    firm historical foundations.</p>
