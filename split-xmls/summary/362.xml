                <p>CCCC MS 362 contains copies written c. 1400 of the so-called <title>Statuta noua</title>, a
                    collection of statutes (or material, such as writs or letters patent, commonly regarded as statutes)
                    of the reign of Edward III. By the time that this copy of the <title>Statuta</title> was made, most
                    versions were probably copied from exemplars held by professional scribes, which means that the
                    occasional presence of a writ to a particular sheriff or official is no guide to the likely
                    provenance of the manuscript. The formal nature of the script, the spaces left for rubricated
                    capitals, the presence of chapter numbers and frequent, though inconsistent, marginal headings,
                    suggests that this book was intended as a formal copy for a practising lawyer. It was not uncommon
                    for such material to be added to in later years, and, in this manuscript, material dating from the
                    reign of Richard II has been added in a different hand.</p>
