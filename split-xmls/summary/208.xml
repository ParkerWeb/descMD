                <p>CCCC MS 208 contains a sixteenth-century copy of a Commentary on the Epistles of St Paul to the
                    Romans written in French. The volume was never part of Matthew Parker's collection; it was donated
                    to Corpus Christi in 1588 by Henry Aldrich (Fellow 1569-79, d. 1593). A note on the endleaf records
                    that, prior to that, it had been in the possession of Antoine-Rodolphe Chevalier, a Protestant
                    refugee from France who became Professor of Hebrew at Cambridge before his death in 1572.</p>
