                <p>CCCC MS 453 contains the <title>Epistolae</title> of Robert Grosseteste (d. 1253), bishop of Lincoln
                    1235-53, copied c. 1430. The letters are an invaluable source for the sometimes brutal
                    ecclesiastical politics of the first half of the thirteenth century and the relationship between the
                    papacy, national churches and the monarchy. It was surely this that made the codex of such interest
                    to Parker, for whom such issues were very far from being mere historical curiosities. This
                    manuscript served as the basis for what remains the only standard edition of Grosseteste's letters,
                    that published for the Rolls Series by Luard in 1861.</p>
