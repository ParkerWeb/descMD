                <p>CCCC MS 505 contains two manuscripts bound together; one probably of the fourteenth century, made in
                    Germany, and the other of the thirteenth century, made in Italy. The first part contains a copy of
                    Heinrich of Herford (before 1326-70), <title>Catena aurea</title>. The second part includes texts on
                    medicine and law: <title>De consolatione medicinarum simplicium</title> (<title>De simplicibus
                        medicinis</title>) by Johannes Mesue (Masawaih al-Mardini), <title>Antidotarium
                    Nicholai</title>, and <title>Commentarium in Digestorum 'De diuersis regulis iuris antiqui'</title>,
                    a work of civil law by Bulgarus of Bologna (d. c. 1166). This volume is part of the Elbing
                    collection; a group of manuscripts which belonged to a Brigittine convent at Elbing (Elblag), near
                    Gdansk. The collection was donated to Corpus Christi College by Richard Pernham (1583?-1628) or his
                    wife, Mary, whose signature is in several of the books..</p>
