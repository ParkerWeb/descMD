            <div xml:id="CCC285" n="MS 285">
                <p>CCCC MS 285 contains the holograph copy of the <title>Vita Henrici V regis Angliae</title> of Tito
                    Livio Frulovisi (d. after 1456), a biography of the Lancastrian king that, it has recently been
                    argued, was a reworking of the pseudo-Elmham's <title>Vita et Gesta Henrici Quinti</title>. Written
                    while Frulovisi was in England in the later 1430s, perhaps 1436-8, the manuscript was once in the
                    possession of Henry VI, though how it came to be in Parker's possession is not known. It was
                    presumably Parker who bound this fifteenth-century humanist text together, somewhat incongruously,
                    with a tenth- or early eleventh-century copy of <title>De laudibus uirginitatis</title> (<title>De
                        virginitate</title>) by Aldhelm (d. 709) to which have been added glosses in a hand identified
                    with a Worcester Cathedral scribe.</p>
