                <p>CCCC MS 88 contains the Commentary on Matthew of Claudius Taurinensis, bishop of Turin (d. c. 827).
                    This work has not been edited, with the exception of the epistolary preface, and some of the early
                    sections which were examined in McMenomy's unpublished Ph.D. dissertation. Claudius wrote this text
                    in the early ninth century; his iconoclastic views led to his often being attacked as a heretic,
                    although he was never officially condemned. This manuscript has split scholarly opinion over its
                    origin: the most usually accepted view is that it was written on the Continent in the tenth century;
                    however it has also been suggested that it was written in England either circa 1000 or in the first
                    half of the eleventh century. It contains a flyleaf from a fifteenth-century service-book. CCCC MS
                    88 may possibly be identifiable with a manuscript seen by John Leland (d. 1552) at Sherborne Abbey
                    in the 1530s. It seems to have later belonged to the historian John Bale (1495-1563), for whom
                    Parker found work at Canterbury in his declining years.</p>
