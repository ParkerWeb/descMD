                <p> CCCC MS 191 is a copy of the bilingual version of the Rule for Canons of Chrodegang of Metz (d.
                    766). It was written in the third quarter of the eleventh century at Exeter, and is probably
                    identifiable as one of the manuscripts given to Exeter by Bishop Leofric (1050-72). Leofric, who was
                    probably from Cornwall although he has an English name, was brought up in Lotharingia, where he
                    encountered Chrodegang's Rule, which sought to encourage communal life among the secular, rather
                    than monastic, clergy. Leofric introduced this rule to Exeter, which he reconstituted as a community
                    of clerics rather than monks when he moved his see there from Crediton in 1050. This manuscript was
                    used by the Parkerian circle for its Old English vocabulary and was annotated by Parker when he was
                    preparing his defence of priests' marriage.</p>
