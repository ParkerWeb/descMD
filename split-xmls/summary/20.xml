                <p>This richly illustrated Apocalypse, CCCC MS 20, was made for Sir Henry de Cobham in the decade before
                    his death in 1339. He kneels in the historiated initial at the beginning of the book. It
                    subsequently passed to Juliana de Leybourne, Countess of Huntingdon (d. 1367) who bequeathed it to
                    St Augustine's Abbey, Canterbury. With no less than 106 pictures, it is one of the finest
                    fourteenth-century illustrated copies of the Apocalypse in Anglo-Norman verse, although the
                    commentary text is in Anglo-Norman prose. It is closely related in both iconography and text to
                    another Anglo-Norman Apocalypse, Toulouse, Bibliothèque municipale MS 815, which is by a different
                    artist. Both manuscripts also contain the Vision of St Paul (the Journey of St Paul to Hell), in
                    Anglo-Norman verse, accompanied by illustrations. In addition, the Corpus manuscript contains the
                    English Coronation Ordo in Anglo-Norman, preceded by a frontispiece showing the crowned king in his
                    coronation vestments, flanked by the bishops. The text mentions a Prince Edward, and may be a
                    version of that used for the coronation of Edward III in 1327. The style of the illustrations
                    suggests the 1330s.</p>
