                <p>CCCC MS 280 contains a copy of the text of the <title>Historia Anglorum</title> of Henry of
                    Huntingdon (c. 1088-c. 1157), a chronicle written in England in the mid-twelfth century. In his
                    edition of 1879 Arnold postulated that this manuscript was once in the library of St Augustine's,
                    Canterbury, but M. R. James was unable to confirm this and Neil Ker rejected the thesis outright.
                    The text as found in this manuscript has been used in the collation of the most recent edition of
                    the text for material after 1138 by Greenway.</p>
