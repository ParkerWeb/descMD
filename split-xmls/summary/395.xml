                <p>CCCC MS 395 is a compilation of alchemical texts copied partly in the early fifteenth century and
                    partly in the late fifteenth or early sixteenth century. It begins with a long text by Iohannes de
                    Rupescissa OFM (Roqetaillade, d. c. 1362 - pseudo-Ramon Lull), his <title>Liber de consideratione
                        quintae essentiae</title>. This section contains a few diagrams and coloured drawings, notably
                    two full-page (ff. 49v-50r) illustrating lunaria grass. The style of this drawing and some texts in
                    Catalan, suggest this part may have been made in Catalonia. Textual additions have been made by an
                    English scribe, and the book seems to have come to England by the second half of the fifteenth
                    century. In addition to a number of other minor alchemical tracts, the codex also contains a number
                    of works attributed to Robert Green of Welby (c. 1467-after 1544), including <title>De fama</title>,
                        <title>Quaestiones super benedicti lapidis philosophici compositione</title>,
                        <title>Secretum</title>, <title>Pulchrum somnium</title> and <title>Dialogus inter Hilardum
                        necromanticum et quendam spiritum</title>. Green's name is also inscribed on a flyleaf of the
                    MS, though it is not clear whether this was intended as a mark of ownership or as a note of the
                    authorship of the texts within the volume.</p>
