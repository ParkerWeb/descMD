                <p>CCCC MS 490 was started in 1613, and contains a list of donations to the library of Corpus Christi
                    College, almost all printed books. In 1648 the volume was turned upside-down and restarted from the
                    back with a list of college plate. This is prefaced by the text of a college resolution that such a
                    list should be kept, perhaps prompted by the political troubles in England during the Civil War,
                    which made heavy inroads into the plate of many Oxbridge colleges; indeed the first 145 cups listed
                    were all sold in 1648 and 1649 according to notes signed by the Master and Bursar, and this record
                    seems to have been a way of commemorating these donations despite the college having sold the gifts
                    themselves. Meanwhile the book donations list was kept going until 1660. The list of plate is
                    decorated with many coats of arms of donors, and contains occasional further records of sales. The
                    list was kept up until circa 1743.</p>
