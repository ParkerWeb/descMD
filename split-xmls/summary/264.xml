                <p>CCCC MS 264 contains two major texts; an incomplete version of the <title>Flores historiarum</title>
                    of Roger of Wendover (d. 1236), beginning with events of Richard I's reign and continuing until
                    1234, and a copy of Bede's <title>Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum</title>. In addition, the
                    early part of the manuscript contains a number of documents relating to Norwich, such as charters
                    and records of agreements with local laymen. This manuscript, copied in the early to mid-fourteenth
                    century, was once in the possession of Simon Bozoun, Prior of Norwich cathedral priory (1344-52),
                    and an inscription to that effect survives in the manuscript. It was presumably from Norwich that
                    Parker acquired this manuscript.</p>
