                <p> CCCC MS 123 is the unique collection of the <title>Epistolae</title> of Herbert of Bosham (d. c.
                    1194), Thomas Becket's secretary and author of a version of the <title>Vita Sancti Thomae
                        Cantuariensis</title>. The <title>Epistolae</title> gathered here do not represent the complete
                    version of the letters as originally conceived, since both the early and later quires have suffered
                    losses. The manuscript was copied in second half of the fourteenth century, though its long-presumed
                    provenance from the cathedral priory of Christ Church, Canterbury, has been disputed by Neil
                    Ker.</p>
