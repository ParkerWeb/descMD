            <div xml:id="CCC370" n="MS 370">
                <p>CCCC MS 370 is another of those manuscripts that may have been intended as light reading matter for a
                    monastic community, containing as it does the perennial favourites of material concerning Alexander
                    the Great in both the version of Julius Valerius (3rd/4th century) and the <title>Historia de
                        Preliis</title>, alongside the fictional exchange of letters between Alexander and various
                    figures in the ancient world. In addition, this codex contains an account of the Black Prince's
                    campaign during the siege of Rouen that has been much used by historians of the Hundred Years' War.
                    The presence of Bishop William Bateman's (d. 1355) <title>Injunctions</title> that resulted from his
                    visitation to the Benedictine Cathedral Priory of Holy Trinity, Norwich in 1347 has led some to
                    conclude that this manuscript was once in the library of that institution, though it lacks a press
                    mark or any other evidence to that effect.</p>
