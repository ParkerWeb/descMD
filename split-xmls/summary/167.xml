                <p>CCCC MS 167 contains a copy of the <title>Abreviacion of Chronicles</title> of John Capgrave OESA
                    (1393-1464). The <title>Abreviacion</title> was completed c. 1462-3 and was, in some senses, an
                    anachronism; the supra-national chronicle or 'world history' having been supplanted by works
                    concentrating on national history. Capgrave's major sources were the <title>Chronicon pontificum et
                        imperatorum</title> of Martin of Troppau (d. 1278) and a lost version of the St Albans chronicle
                    of Thomas of Walsingham OSB (d. 1422). The text in the Corpus manuscript, produced c. 1500, was once
                    thought to have been a copy of the autograph version of the material in Cambridge UL MS Gg.4.12, but
                    it is now thought instead to derive from a lost author's working copy of the
                        <title>Abreviacion</title>. It is not known how this codex came to be in Parker's
                    collection.</p>
