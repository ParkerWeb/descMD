                <p>CCCC MS 500, probably made in Prague, is part of the Elbing Collection brought back from the
                    abandoned Brigittine convent at what is now Elblag in Poland by Richard Pernham (1583?-1628) in the
                    early 1620s and donated to Corpus Christi either by himself or by his wife Mary, whose name is
                    inscribed in many books of the collection. The codex, written in two late fourteenth- or early
                    fifteenth-century hands, is a miscellany manuscript of devotional and theological texts, including
                    the <title>Expositio missae</title> by Jan Isner (d. 1411), the <title>Breuiloquium pauperis</title>
                    of Bonaventure OFM (1217/21-74), the <title>De miseria humanae conditionis</title> by Pope Innocent
                    III (1160/61-1216 - pope 1198-1216), Henricus de Frimaria OESA (d. 1340), <title>Tractatus de
                        quatuor instinctibus</title>, excerpts from the <title>Revelations</title> of Birgitta of Sweden
                    (1302/3-73) and the <title>Euangelium Nicodemi</title>. The fact that Birgitta is described as a
                    saint in this version of the text must date the writing of the second portion of the book to after
                    1391, the date of her canonisation.</p>
