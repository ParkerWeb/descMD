                <p>MS 66, as described by M. R. James, included half of a manuscript belonging to the Cistercian abbey
                    of Sawley (Yorks.) and half of a manuscript belonging to the Benedictine abbey of Bury St Edmunds.
                    The other two halves of the Bury and Sawley manuscripts are bound together as Cambridge, UL MS Ff.
                    1. 27. However, MS 66 has since been separated into MS 66 (Sawley MS) and <ref type="ms"
                        target="CCC066A">MS 66A</ref> (Bury MS). The volume now known as MS 66 contains copies of the
                        <title>Imago mundi</title> of Honorius Augustodunensis (fl. first half of twelfth century);
                    Extracts from Pliny the Elder and Solinus; the <title>Historia Anglorum</title>; <title>De statu
                        ecclesiae</title> by Gilbert of Limerick (d. 1145); Theobald of &#201;tampes's Letter to
                    Robert Bloet, Bishop of Lincoln; <title>De sex alis cherubim</title> and <title>De tribus in
                        penitentia considerandis</title> both by Clement of Llanthony OSA (d. after 1169), and a
                    treatise on confession. The <title>Imago mundi</title> and <title>De sex alis cherubim</title>
                    contain four large framed coloured drawings and a map of the world.</p>
