                <p>The Revd. William Favell, an old member of the college (matric. 1922), gave this illuminated French
                    Psalter, CCCC MS 628, to Corpus Christi College in 1976. It was probably made in Paris c. 1240,
                    certainly after 1234 because St Dominic, canonised in that year, is in the Litany. At the liturgical
                    divisions of the Psalter there are eight fine full-page historiated initials. The figure style
                    derives out of that of the artists of the <title>Bibles moralisées</title> made for the French royal
                    family in the period c. 1220-40.</p>
