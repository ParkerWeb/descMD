                <p>CCCC MS 507, dating from the late fourteenth century, probably made in Germany, contains a collection
                    of sermons. The main part of the book contains the <title>Sermones quadragesimales</title> by
                    Iacobus de Voragine OP (d. 1298), a series of sermons for the season of Lent. It also contains
                    sermons attributed to Bernard of Clairvaux OCist (1090-1153), and Henricus de Frimaria OESA (d.
                    1340). This volume is part of the Elbing collection; a group of manuscripts which belonged to a
                    Brigittine convent at Elbing (Elblag), near Gdansk. The collection was donated to Corpus Christi
                    College by either Richard Pernham (1583?-1628) or his wife Mary, whose name is in many of these
                    books.</p>
