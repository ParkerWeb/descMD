                <p>CCCC MS 80 contains Henry Lovelich's English versions of <title>The History of the Holy Grail</title>
                    and <title>Merlin</title> written c. 1450-75. The Corpus manuscript is the unique copy of these
                    texts, translated and versified from the French prose version. Lovelich was a member of the
                    Skinners' Company of London, and it seems likely that, until it came into Parker's possession, this
                    manuscript had remained in or around London. Certainly it contains a number of notes added in the
                    later fifteenth century in the hand of John Cok, a priest at the Augustinian hospital of St
                    Bartholomew at Smithfield.</p>
