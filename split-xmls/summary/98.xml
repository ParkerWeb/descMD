                <p> CCCC MS 98 is a genealogical roll in French and Latin, illustrating the history of the Welsh and
                    English royal lines and that of the Lacy family. On the dorse of the roll appears a Latin prose
                    genealogy from Adam to Henry V. On the basis of its decoration and style, the roll has been dated to
                    c, 1470, a conclusion supported by the slightly defensive description of Edward IV (who had been
                    deposed and regained the throne in 1470-71) as 'dei gratia uerus et indubitatus Rex'. It is not
                    known how this roll came into Parker's possession.</p>
