                <p>CCCC MS 334 contains Jerome's translation of Origen's homilies on Luke. It was written in the type of
                    script known as "a-z minuscule", one of the many European pre-Caroline minuscules, probably at a
                    nunnery in Laon in the eighth century. It shares scribes with other Laon books, and has a note
                    saying that it was written by one 'Fortunatus'. It contains some fish and animal decoration very
                    typical in manuscripts of its date from northern France. There is no record of how it came into
                    Parker's hands, and no evidence that it was in England in the Middle Ages.</p>
