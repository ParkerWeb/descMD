                <p>The main text in CCCC MS 458 is the <title>De providentia Dei</title> by John Chrysostom (c. 347-407)
                    in the translation by Ambrogio Traversari (Ambrose of Camaldoli) OSB Camald. (1386-1439). This is
                    followed by a sermon by John Chrysostom and the <title>Historia Griseldis</title> by Francesco
                    Petrarca (1304-74). At the end of the book is a short tract on tribulation. The manuscript was made
                    in the southern Netherlands, and the sermon by John Chrysostom has a colophon dating its writing to
                    1468. A coloured woodcut of the Doubting of Thomas has later been pasted into the book.</p>
