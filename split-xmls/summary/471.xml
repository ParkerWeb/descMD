                <p>CCCC MS 471, contains the unique copy of the devotional poem in Anglo-Norman by John of Howden (d.
                    1275), <title>Rossignos</title>, the manuscript dating to the late fourteenth century, some hundred
                    years after the poem's original composition. Howden's exact identity is uncertain, but he was
                    probably a royal clerk in the household of Queen Eleanor of Provence, consort of Henry III and the
                    mother of Edward I. The poem is dedicated to Eleanor and is a reworking of Howden's earlier Latin
                    work, <title>Philomena</title>. The manuscript was probably in Parker's possession by 1564, as
                    revealed by a scribbled note bearing that date. Other notes record the name of 'Franciscus
                    Aldriche', but it seems unlikely that this is the same man who attended Clare College in the 1580s
                    and rose to be Master of Sidney Sussex College in 1608.</p>
