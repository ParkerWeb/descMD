                <p>CCCC MS 302 is an important collection of Old English homilies, mostly by Ælfric of Eynsham (c.
                    950-c. 1010). It was written in the early twelfth century, probably in south-east England. It
                    contains late Old English spellings, and is an important witness to the use made of the Anglo-Saxon
                    homiletic tradition after the Norman Conquest. It was Parker's fifth volume of homilies in his
                    numeration system.</p>
