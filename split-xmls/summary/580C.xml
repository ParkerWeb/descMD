                <p>CCCC MS 580 is now divided into three distinct volumes, A, B and C, each containing tabulated copies
                    of the returns of one of the three dioceses of Canterbury, Ely and Bedfordshire sent in answer to
                    Parker's request for information concerning incumbents sent out in 1560 and 1561. They were once
                    part of the similar returns material found in <ref type="MS" target="CCC097">CCCC MS 97</ref> and
                        <ref type="MS" target="CCC122">122</ref> but had at some stage been removed to the college's
                    modern archives before being returned to the Parker collection in 1959.</p>
