                <p>The <title>Pictor in carmine</title>, contained in CCCC MS 300, is a treatise intended for painters,
                    written in the late twelfth or early thirteenth century, in which events of the New Testament are
                    provided with typological parallels from the Old, all having accompanying verses. This manuscript,
                    dating from the thirteenth century, contains the long version of the text which exists in six other
                    MSS. The work has been attributed to Adam of Dore OCist, who was Abbot of Dore (Herefordshire) and
                    died at some time after 1216. The text has been edited from this manuscript by K.-A. Wirth.</p>
