            <div xml:id="CCC512" n="MS 512">
                <p>CCCC MS 512 is a fifteenth-century manuscript, written in Bohemia, containing a number of religious
                    tracts and papal bulls of Popes Clement VI, Urban VI, Clement VII, Boniface IX, Gregory XI, and
                    Urban VI. Among the main religious tracts are a major work by Thomas Aquinas OP (c. 1225-74),
                        <title>Quaestiones super libros sententiarum</title> (<title>Abbreuiationes</title>), Michael of
                    Massa (Michele Beccucci de Massa) OESA (c.1298-1337), <title>Historia passionis Jesu
                    Christi</title>, a commentary on Psalms attributed to Nicholas de Gorran OP (1232- c.1295),
                    pseudo-Augustine, <title>De essentia diuinitatis</title>, and excerpts from pseudo-Bernard of
                    Clairvaux, <title>Speculum peccatoris</title>. The Bohemian origin of the volume is suggested by a
                    note on the back flyleaf which has a deed relating to the parish church of Gumeyn (Brno-Komín) in
                    the diocese of Olomouc. This volume is part of the Elbing collection; a group of manuscripts which
                    belonged to a Brigittine convent at Elbing (Elblag), near Gdansk. The collection was donated to
                    Corpus Christi College by Richard Pernham (1583?-1628) or his wife, Mary whose signature is in many
                    of the boks.</p>
