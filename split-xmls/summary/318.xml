                <p>The two parts of CCCC MS 318 may once have been separate manuscripts, but they were certainly
                    together at Rochester in the twelfth century, when a contents list and an anathema were added to the
                    volume. The first part is a twelfth-century collection of hagiography containing vitae of Edward the
                    Confessor, Anselm of Canterbury, Herluin of Bec, and the Venerable Bede. The second part is also a
                    twelfth-century collection of hagiography, but with some romance material as well: it contains texts
                    on James the apostle, Charlemagne and Roland, Bishop Turpin, Thecla, and Apollonius of Tyre. An
                    inscription says that the manuscript was given to Parker by a deacon of Rochester.</p>
