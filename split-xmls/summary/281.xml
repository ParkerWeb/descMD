                <p>CCCC MS 281 is a manuscript of diverse texts made up of three distinct volumes copied between the
                    twelfth and fourteenth centuries. The material contained within the codex is wide-ranging but
                    broadly historical in nature. It includes a copy of <title>Historia regum Britanniae</title> of
                    Geoffrey of Monmouth (d. 1154), an anonymous <title>Annal</title> from the birth of Christ to the
                    mid-fourteenth century, an extract from the Latin version of the account of the death of Edward II
                    attributed to Thomas de la More (fl. mid-fourteenth century) and historical documents relating to
                    King Edward I's relations with Scotland. The manuscript has sometimes been described as having once
                    been in the possession of the Benedictine abbey of St Modwenna in Burton-on-Trent, but Nasmith
                    concluded, on the basis of the text of the <title>Annals</title>, that they were written at the
                    Cluniac house of St Andrew's, Northampton.</p>
