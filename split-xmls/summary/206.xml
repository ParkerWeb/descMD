                <p>CCCC MS 206 is a volume of philosophical works of the type which were studied at a high level in late
                    Anglo-Saxon England. It contains texts by Boethius, Martianus Capella, Alcuin, and Aristotle.
                    Although there has been much debate about its origins, it was probably written in England in the
                    first half of the tenth century. The script is a form of Caroline minuscule with many Insular
                    abbreviations, and both North East France and Wales have also been suggested as possible places of
                    origin. It was never owned by Parker, and probably came to Corpus from the collection of Daniel
                    Rogers, d. 1581, eldest son of one of Foxe's martyrs.</p>
