            <div xml:id="CCC155" n="MS 155">
                <p>CCCC MS 155 is an early fourteenth-century manuscript containing many of the works of Anselm of
                    Canterbury OSB (d. 1109), including his <title>Proslogion</title>, <title>Monologion</title> and
                        <title>Cur Deus homo</title>. The manuscript is in a fine hand, with two illuminated historiated
                    and many ornamental initials. The initial on the first folio, in gold and colour, contains a
                    depiction of Anselm. James tentatively suggested a Norwich provenance, but this has been rejected by
                    Ker. The book has fore-edge painting of heraldic shields, and is one of the best examples of this in
                    the collection. </p>
