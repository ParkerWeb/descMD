                <p>CCCC MS 412 contains not Giles of Rome OESA's <title>De regimine principum</title> but an anonymous
                    work in the same genre of guidance on royal governance, the <title>Liber de informatione
                        principum</title>, written between 1297 and 1314, perhaps for the sons of Philip the Fair. It
                    seems at least plausible. however, that Parker was just as interested in the late fifteenth-century
                    copy of the <title>Articuli cleri</title> (1316) that is attached to the beginning of the volume and
                    which deals with the question of royal and ecclesiastical jurisdiction. This is followed by a series
                    of notes bearing the name Edmund Poplay, who seems to have been confirmed as a bachelor of canon law
                    at Cambridge University in 1489, though no contemporary reference to him is known in the university
                    Grace Books. Apart from this, there is no information as to the manuscript's provenance.</p>
