                <p>CCCC MS 384 contains a sixteenth-century copy of the first Epistle of St John in Arabic and Latin.
                    This manuscript was not part of Matthew Parker's bequest to Corpus Christi but instead bears a
                    donation inscription stating the donor to have been one Thomas Dag (or Day). That this manuscript is
                    missing from Thomas James' catalogue of 1600 suggests that this manuscript did not find its way into
                    the college until the early seventeenth century.</p>
