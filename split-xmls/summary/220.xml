                <p>CCCC MS 220 is a late thirteenth-century manuscript containing letters of Petrus de Vinea (c.
                    1190-1249), some of which are incomplete, and a copy of the <title>Life of St Eustace</title> (BHL
                    2760). Petrus de Vinea was a stateman and lawyer at the court of the Emperor Frederick II in
                    southern Italy and Sicily. It has been suggested that this manuscript was donated to Corpus Christi
                    College by Christopher Kaley (admitted 1636).</p>
