                <p>CCCC MS 166 is an manuscript written in an Italic hand, probably made in Rome in the late 1460s or
                    shortly afterwards. The first part, ff. 1-74, contains the work on peace and war by Rodrigo Sánchez
                    de Arévalo, <title>Disputatio de pace et bello</title> and his <title>Oratio ad suscipiendum iustum
                        bellum contra Turcum</title>. The rest of the book contains transcripts of letters between
                    Rodrigo and the humanists of the Roman Academy, such as Bartolomeo Platina and Pomponio Leto, during
                    the time of their imprisonment in Castel Sant'Angelo in 1468-9. Rodrigo, later to become bishop of
                    Calahorra, was the governor of Castel Sant'Angelo. It is not known how such a book came to England.
                    In the sixteenth century it was owned by Thomas Godsalve, notary public of Norwich, and in 1567 by
                    Peter Hobard of Dennington. The book is decorated with one large initial in gold with white branch
                    work, and a few smaller initials of the same type.</p>
