                <p>CCCC MS 488 contains a copy of John Joscelyn's <title>Historiola Collegii Corporis Christi</title>
                    dated 1569. John Joscelyn (1529–1603) was Matthew Parker's Latin secretary. He proved very adept at
                    finding Old English manuscripts and at preparing them for publication. In addition to his work on
                    Old English he also wrote this history of Corpus Christi College and also a biography of Matthew
                    Parker which can also be found in the Parker Library manuscript collection (see <ref type="MS"
                        target="CCC489">CCCC MS 489</ref>).</p>
