                <p>The ex libris inscription of this thirteenth-century manuscript gives it a provenance at the
                    Dominican convent, London. However, on f. ivr is a fragment of a deed, dated to 1515, in the name of
                    the public notary of Norwich diocese, suggesting that the manuscript may have been in Norwich in the
                    early sixteenth century. The manuscript contains Hugh of Saint-Victor OSA (c. 1096-1141) on the
                    Celestial Hierarchy by pseudo-Dionysius, as well as numerous texts by Augustine, pseudo-Augustine,
                    Isidore of Seville (c. 560-636), Jerome, Drogo of Laon (fl. c. 1100) and others. The final section
                    of the manuscript is the only extant copy of the first recension of Alexander of Canterbury (fl.
                    1100-1110), <title>Liber ex dictis beati Anselmi</title>.</p>
