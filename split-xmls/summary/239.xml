            <div xml:id="CCC239" n="MS 239">
                <p>CCCC MS 239 is a copy of the Latin translation of Aristotle's <title>Metaphysics</title> made in
                    England and dating to the period c. 1250-75. It was perhaps given, together with several other
                    books, to Corpus Christi College by Daniel Rogers, probably the Latin scholar and diplomat who was a
                    contemporary of Matthew Parker and lived c. 1539-91. The <title>Metaphysics</title> was an important
                    text for the medieval university curriculum, and the script and ornament suggests this copy might
                    have been made in Oxford. Although now partly rebound with modern binding, part of the red skin
                    medieval binding survives, with evidence that it once had clasps, and there is some indication of
                    marks for the attachment of a chain.</p>
