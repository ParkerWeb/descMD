                <p>A luxury copy, dating from c. 1300, perhaps made in Paris, of the <title>Speculum historiale</title>,
                    Books IX-XVI, by the Dominican, Vincent of Beauvais (1189/94-c. 1264), having fine illuminated
                    initials and decorative borders. CCCC MSS 13 and <ref type="ms" target="CCC014">14</ref> are vols.
                    II and III of a three-volume set, of which volume I is Cambridge, St John's College MS B.21. It
                    belonged to St Augustine's Abbey, Canterbury. This is an encyclopaedia of history which was
                    extremely popular in the Middle Ages, and exists in printed copies as late as the seventeenth
                    century. </p>
