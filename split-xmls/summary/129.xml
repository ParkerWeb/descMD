                <p>CCCC MS 129 contains thirteenth-century copies of the <title>Breuiarium ab urbe condita</title> of
                    Eutropius (fl. 363-80), the anonymous <title>Gesta Alexandri</title> (<title>Historia de Preliis
                        Alexandri Magni</title>) and Richard de Templo OSA (fl. late twelfth century),
                        <title>Itinerarium peregrinorum et gesta regis Ricardi</title>. It has been suggested, though
                    not certainly established, that the manuscript was produced in St Augustine's, Canterbury. However,
                    it was certainly at St Augustine's in the fifteenth century, where it appears in the library
                    catalogue, and was one of the manuscripts saved at the dissolution by the antiquary John Twyne (d.
                    1581). A Parkerian note in the manuscript records how Twyne sent this codex to Parker.</p>
