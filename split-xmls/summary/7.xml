                <p>CCCC MS 7, dating from c. 1400-25, contains the <title>Chronica maiora</title> and its continuations
                    by the St Albans chronicler Thomas Walsingham (c. 1370-c. 1422), together with an incomplete copy of
                    his <title>Gesta abbatum Sancti Albani</title> copied from London, BL MS Cotton Claudius E. IV. In
                    addition, the manuscript contains a finely illustrated copy of Walsingham's <title>Liber
                        benefactorum Sancti Albani</title> in an abridged version derived from London, BL MS Cotton Nero
                    D. VII, and the <title>Annales Ricardi II et Henrici IV</title> attributed to William Wintershill.
                    Numerous illustrations represent the benefactors, a few as full figures but mostly as busts or
                    heads. The gatherings of the manuscript are in a confused condition, the volume having been found in
                    William Wintershill's cell in St Albans Abbey after his death (c. 1435) 'in quaternis derelictum'
                    and rebound at that time or shortly afterwards.</p>
