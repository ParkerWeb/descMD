                <p>CCCC 531 contains a commentary on the <title>Sentences</title> of Peter Lombard (c. 1095-1160) by an
                    unknown author. There are occasional notes in German, and the book was probably made in Germany in
                    the late fourteenth or early fifteenth century. Only part of its cover remains. This volume is part
                    of the Elbing collection, a group of manuscripts associated with the Brigittine convent at Elbing
                    (Elblag), near Gdansk which was founded in 1458 and deserted in 1521. Almost all the Elbing
                    manuscripts contain the ownership inscription of Mary Pernham, wife of Richard Pernham (d. 1628),
                    Fellow of the college and <hi rend="italic">pastor Anglicus</hi> of St Marien church in Elbing from
                    1618-24.</p>
