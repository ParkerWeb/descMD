            <div xml:id="CCC472" n="MS 472">
                <p>Although CCCC MS 472, made in the middle or third quarter of the fifteenth century in Oxford,
                    contains a collection of humanist texts, including one dedicated to Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester
                    (1390-1447), it is written in rather inelegant gothic cursive scripts, showing no influence of
                    Italian humanist scribes. Its contents includes Isidore of Seville (c. 560-636), <title>De ortu et
                        obitu patrum</title>, Pietro del Monte (c. 1400-57), <title>De uitiorum inter se differentia et
                        comparatione</title> (a work on the vices and virtues, written in 1438 and dedicated to Humphrey
                    of Gloucester), Isocrates, <title>Oratio ad Demonicum</title>, works of Plutarch, Lucian, Xenophon
                    and Plato edited by the Italian humanists, and Leonardo Bruni (1369-1444),
                    <title>Isagogicon</title>. Perhaps the volume belonged to Duke Humphrey, although this is unlikely
                    as it seems to postdate his death.</p>
