                <p>This book is in an extremely fragile condition and it has not been possible for it to be imaged, save
                    for the front exterior, the first leaf recto foliated as f. a, and the back exterior - the boards do
                    not survive. The paper is disintegrating and cannot be stabilised, so it has not even been possible
                    to foliate the manuscript throughout. CCCC MS 525, probably made in Germany or Bohemia, contains a
                    series of sermons for the church year and a penitential text, <title>Penitentiale aureum</title>, by
                    a certain Johannes Cappellanus. This volume is part of the Elbing collection; a group of manuscripts
                    which belonged to a Brigittine convent at Elbing (Elblag), near Gdansk. The collection was donated
                    to Corpus Christi College by either Richard Pernham (1583?-1628) or his wife Mary, whose name is in
                    many of these books.</p>
