                <p>CCCC MS 198 is an important collection of Old English homilies, mostly by Ælfric of Eynsham OSB (c.
                    950-c. 1010). It was written in the first half of the eleventh century and received a number of
                    additions in the second half. It also contains a neumed office for St Guthlac added towards the end
                    of the eleventh century. The manuscript may have been written at Worcester; although the textual
                    associations of the main body are south-eastern, the additions appear from their spellings to be
                    from the west of England, and in the thirteenth century it was annotated by the scribe known as the
                    'Worcester Tremulous Hand'. It was Parker's fourth volume of homilies in his numeration system.</p>
