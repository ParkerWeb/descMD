                <p>CCCC MS 441, made in the middle years of the thirteenth century, is one of the best examples in the
                    Parker collection of a miscellany of short texts, thirty-four in all, which were often assembled for
                    the needs of an individual patron. In this case the texts are penitential, moral, didactic and
                    theological tracts, with some material also relating to sermons. The book belonged to Richard de
                    Weynchepe, a monk, who became prior of the Benedictine priory of Dover in 1268, but the volume seems
                    to have reverted to the library of Dover's mother house, Christ Church, Canterbury; it is listed in
                    the early fourteenth-century catalogue of Christ Church library by Henry of Eastry.</p>
