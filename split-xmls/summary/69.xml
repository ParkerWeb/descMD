                <p>CCCC MS 69, containing Gregory the Great's Forty Homilies on the Gospels, was written in Insular
                    Hybrid minuscule and decorated in typical Insular fashion with red dots, interlace, and occasional
                    animal heads. It was probably made in England south of the Humber, dating to the early part of the
                    early ninth century, and is as such a relatively late product of the Insular book-producing
                    tradition in England, which was to be greatly disrupted by Viking attacks of the middle of the ninth
                    century. The text was used by Étaix in his edition of the work, although he denigrated it as
                    containing terrible readings and fantastic spellings; but its place of origin and early date seemed
                    to him too significant for the manuscript to be ignored.</p>
