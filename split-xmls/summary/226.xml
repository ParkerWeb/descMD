                <p>The text in CCCC MS 226 of the <title>De poenitentia sub persona Magdalenae</title> has been
                    attributed to Stephen Langton (c. 1150-1228), archbishop of Canterbury (1207-28), but also to his
                    younger brother Simon Langton (d. 1248), archdeacon of Canterbury. The book was given to the
                    cathedral priory of Christ Church, Canterbury by the monk, Hugh of Girune OSB (d. after 1239), and
                    is listed in the early fourteenth-century catalogue of the priory's books. It originally formed a
                    single volume with <ref type="ms" target="CCC222">CCCC MS 222</ref> which contains his inscription
                    of ownership.</p>
