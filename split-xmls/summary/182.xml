            <div xml:id="CCC182" n="MS 182">
                <p>CCCC MS 182 contains an English version of the <title>Brut</title> chronicle ('Extended Version to
                    1419' (Group C)) copied in the second quarter of the fifteenth century and supplied with some
                    handsome decorative initials. As one of several chronicles of English history in the collection,
                    this volume in particular reveals Parker's efforts to collate the information provided by his other
                    sources. Notes in Parker's hand in this manuscript reveal that he compared the text of the
                        <title>Brut</title> to another copy in <ref type="ms" target="CCC174">CCCC MS 174</ref> and that
                    he cross-referenced this text with the unique copy of the <title>Scalacronica</title> also in his
                    possession (now <ref type="ms" target="CCC133">CCCC MS 133</ref>). There is no evidence of this
                    manuscript's provenance or how it came to be in Parker's collection.</p>
