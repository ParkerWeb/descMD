                <p>CCCC MS 313 contains a collection of historical texts copied in a late tweflth- or early
                    thirteenth-century hand. The two major works in the manuscript are the <title>Epitoma de Tito
                        Livio</title> of Lucius Annaeus Florus (fl. c. 140), an account of Roman history, and the
                        <title>Opuscula</title> of Ralph de Diceto (d. 1199/1200), a work of history from the
                    Incarnation to his own day comprised of extracts from his own and other authors' works. Although
                    such material appealed to Parker, there is very little clues as to how this manuscript came into
                    Parker's possession apart from the name 'Byny' written in Parker's characteristic red chalk on one
                    of the flyleaves.</p>
