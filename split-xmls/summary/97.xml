                <p> During the middle years of the sixteenth century, the Privy Council requested that the Archbishop of
                    Canterbury supply them with detailed information regarding the holders of English clerical
                    benefices; details such as their level of education, whether or not they were resident or held
                    multiple livings, and their marital status. <ref type="ms" target="CCC122">CCCC MS 122</ref> and MS
                    97 contain numerous documents relating to this inquiry, including the Privy Council's initial
                    request to Archbishop Matthew Parker, a draft version of Parker's request for information from the
                    bishops and the detailed returns he received back from the bishops (often referred to as the 'Parker
                    Certificates'). Some missing leaves from these two manuscripts, now <ref type="ms" target="CCC580A"
                        >CCCC MS 580</ref>, were discovered in the College Archives and transferred to the Parker
                    Library in 1959.</p>
