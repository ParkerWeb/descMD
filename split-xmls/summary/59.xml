            <div xml:id="CCC059" n="MS 59">
                <p>CCCC MS 59, dating from the early fourteenth century, is a collection of texts probably designed to
                    appeal to a monastic audience's hunger for knowledge of the world beyond its walls. Among the
                    manuscript's profusion of texts and documents are the spurious <title>Letters</title> of Prester
                    John and of Alexander the Great to Aristotle, statutes, charters and papal bulls. There is a much
                    interest in chronological material, with short chronicles being accompanied by lists of popes,
                    emperors, kings and archbishops of Canterbury. The precise provenance of this manuscript is unknown,
                    though a continuation of one of the most substantial texts in the codex, <title>Chronica pontificum
                        et imperatorum</title> by Martin of Troppau OP (d. 1278), records the martyrdom of Thomas de la
                    Hale of Dover, suggesting a link to the south coast of England, possibly the Premonstratensian abbey
                    of the Virgin and St Thomas the Martyr at West Langdon, Kent.</p>
