                <p>CCCC MS 223 is an example of the type of manuscript which was being imported into late Anglo-Saxon
                    England from the Continent. It contains a number of works by Prudentius (348-c. 410), including his
                    famous <title>Psychomachia</title>, as well as the unique surviving copy of a poem by John Scotus
                    Eriugena (c. 810-c. 877) to the Carolingian emperor, Charles the Bald. It was written at the abbey
                    of Saint-Vaast in Arras around the third quarter of the ninth century. By the end of the ninth
                    century it had moved to the abbey of Saint-Bertin at Saint-Omer, where some annals were added to
                    leaves at the front. In the tenth century it moved to England, and where it acquired additions and
                    glosses, some in Old English. It has been suggested that Grimbald of Saint-Bertin, who came to
                    England in the 890s at the request of King Alfred, may have brought this manuscript with him. This
                    manuscript was one of the books owned by Daniel Rogers.</p>
