                <p>CCCC MS 450 contains a miscellany of more than 100 distinct items copied in a number of hands of the
                    thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. The single largest volume is a copy of the <title>Summa
                        dictaminis</title> or <title>Summa notariae</title> of John of Bologna (fl. late thirteenth
                    century). The remainder of the manuscript is taken up with a wide range of material, from the
                    satirical Golias poems to extracts from the <title>Secreta secretorum</title>, verses on the fall of
                    Troy, the spurious correspondence of Alexander the Great, and proverbs in Latin and French. In
                    addition, the codex contains a number of ecclesiastical documents and texts relating to relations
                    between the papacy and the thrones of England and France. Some of the material relates to Durham,
                    and it is commonly assumed that this establishes the provenance of the manuscript before it came
                    into Parker's possession.</p>
