                <p> This manuscript, dating from the fourth quarter of the fifteenth century, contains a copy of the
                        <title>Compendium in Iob</title> by Peter of Blois (c.1135-c.1203); excerpts from miscellaneous
                    authorities, including an exposition on the Mass by Richard the Premonstratensian (fl. late twelfth
                    century), which James mistakenly attributed to Remigius of Auxerre; <title>De probacione
                        uirginitatis beatae Mariae</title> by Robert Grosseteste (d. 1253), which is his translation of
                    the second article of the Greek <title>Lexicon Suida</title>, an historical encyclopaedia of the
                    tenth century; and a copy of the Latin version of the <title>Historia trium regum</title> by John of
                    Hildesheim (d. 1375). The manuscript is written in a good, clear hand; its provenance has not been
                    identified.</p>
