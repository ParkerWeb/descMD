            <div xml:id="CCC042" n="MS 42">
                <p>MS 42 is a compilation of saints' lives made at the Benedictine priory of Dover dating to the second
                    quarter of the twelfth century. Its provenance is given by the typical Dover arrangement of two
                    classmark- and contents-inscriptions, one on the opening page and one further on in the book; the
                    classmark matches these up to an entry in the Dover catalogue of 1389 which gives the opening words
                    of the page on which the second inscription occurs. We can be fairly certain that it was originally
                    written at Dover because the same hand also occurs in another Dover manuscript, <ref type="ms"
                        target="CCC462">CCCC MS 462</ref>. The manuscript contains hagiographical texts, starting with
                    the standard life of Martin of Tours, the epitome of a bishop saint. Two of the lives included are
                    of very important English saints, Edmund king and martyr and Dunstan, archbishop of Canterbury. It
                    also contains an unusual collection of miracles of the Virgin Mary, and an incomplete legendary with
                    some musical notation.</p>
