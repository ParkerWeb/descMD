                <p>CCCC MS 261 contains a fifteenth-century copy of John of Gaddesden's <title>Rosa medicinae</title>, a
                    text originally written while Gaddesden was studying medicine at Merton College, Oxford, between
                    1307 and 1316 (probably c. 1313). He was the only English-educated writer on medical matters to gain
                    some recognition among the schools of mainland Europe, and it is sometimes stated that Chaucer
                    modelled his <title>Doctor of Physik</title> on Gaddesden. Whether that is the case or not, he was
                    certainly regarded as a talented physician, gaining employment within the household of Edward the
                    Black Prince, who rewarded him with a rose made of gold, perhaps in a reference to Gaddesden's most
                    well-known work.</p>
