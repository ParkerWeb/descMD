                <p>The provenance of CCCC MS 329 gives every appearance of being firmly established as originating from
                    the Benedictine priory of Thetford (Norfolk). Written c. 1425-50, the manuscript contains a number
                    of texts associating it with the priory of the Blessed Virgin Mary. These include a statement about
                    the authorship of John Bramis (fl. fourteenth century) of the <title>Historia regis Waldei</title>,
                    to the unique copy of the <title>History of Thetford priory</title> by Geoffrey of Rocherio OSB (d.
                    1301), both texts found in this volume. There is also an anonymous account of a miracle attending
                    the repairs carried out on the buildings of the priory. Yet, as James observed, another anonymous
                        <title>Chronicle</title> from the incarnation to the year 1399, that also appears in this
                    manuscript, takes a close interest in the affairs of the nearby priory of Augustinian canons at
                    Ixworth (Suffolk). Parker no doubt valued it for its account of church history from his home county
                    of Norfolk, but how it came into his possession is not known.</p>
