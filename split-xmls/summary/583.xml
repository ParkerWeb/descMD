                <p>CCCC MS 583 is in the form of a short roll containing biographical notes about Matthew Parker
                    probably written by Parker himself and added to by his son, John Parker. It is one of a very small
                    number of sources that mentions, however briefly, his activities during the reign of Mary Tudor
                    (1553-8), an otherwise dark period in Parker's public life. It has been stated that this document
                    was probably donated to the college by Thomas Tenison, archbishop of Canterbury 1695-1715 (it was
                    certainly in the College's possession when Strype printed it from this unique copy in his 'Life' of
                    Parker in 1711), which may indicate that it was found among the archiepiscopal archives.</p>
