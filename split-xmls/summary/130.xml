                <p>CCCC MS 130 contains a collection of pseudo-Isidorean decretals known as the <title>Collectio
                        Lanfranci</title>. It is one of two early versions of the material (the other being in
                    Cambridge, Peterhouse MS 74) probably copied from Trinity College, Cambridge MS B.16.44 which came
                    from Lanfranc's see of Bec in Normandy. The Corpus manuscript was generally believed to have been
                    produced in Canterbury in the early twelfth century, but although the date is still agreed upon, the
                    location of its production is no longer certain.</p>
