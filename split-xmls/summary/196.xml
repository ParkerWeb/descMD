                <p>CCCC MS 196 was probably once part of the same volume as <ref type="ms" target="CCC191">CCCC MS
                        191</ref> and part of <ref type="ms" target="CCC201">CCCC MS 201</ref>; they may have been
                    separated by Parker. They were made at Exeter in the time of Bishop Leofric (1050-72). MS 196 is an
                    important manuscript of the Old English martyrology, though missing some material for December to
                    March: Kotzor used it as the base text for his edition from 19 March to 21 December. It also
                    contains the Old English <title>Vindicta saluatoris</title>, a translation of an apocryphon which
                    interprets the destruction of the Jewish Temple by Titus in A.D. 70 as motivated by his desire to
                    avenge the Crucifixion upon the Jews. Parker obtained several volumes from Exeter Cathedral, some
                    decades before the majority of its medieval manuscripts were given to the Bodleian Library in
                    1602.</p>
