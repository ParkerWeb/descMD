                <p>CCCC MS 210 contains the unique copy of William Worcester's <title>Itineraria</title>. William
                    Worcester (1415-1480/85), a servant of Sir John Fastolf, wrote the <title>Itineraria</title> in note
                    form during a series of journeys he undertook throughout southern and western England between 1478
                    and 1480, and the manuscript must date from this period. The text's eclectic mixture of local
                    history, biography and geography reflect a lively and curious mind. How this manuscript came into
                    Parker's possession is unknown, and it has been suggested that the codex was another bequest to the
                    college by Henry Aldrich (Fellow 1569-79, d. 1593) (see <ref type="ms" target="CCC208">CCCC MS
                        208</ref>). However, the presence of Parker's characteristic red chalk in the volume and the
                    existence of a partial transcript of the text in <ref type="ms" target="CCC101">CCCC MS 101</ref>
                    must refute that claim. Instead, it is probable that Parker acquired the manuscript shortly before
                    his death, after the composition of his <title>Register</title>, <ref type="ms" target="CCC575">CCCC
                        MS 575</ref>, which contains no reference to this manuscript.</p>
