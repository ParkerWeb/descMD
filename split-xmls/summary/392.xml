                <p>Three separate volumes by several hands of the second half of the fifteenth century have been bound
                    together to form CCCC 392. The ten tracts in the manuscript are on various subjects, but several are
                    concerned with the virtues and vices. The first part has Boniohannes de Messana OP (fl. fourteenth
                    century), <title>Quadripartitus</title>, Petrus de Pennis OP (fl. 1395-1418), <title>Tractatus
                        contra Iudaeos nomine Thalamoth</title> (<title>Talmud</title>), and John of Fécamp,
                        <title>Confessio fidei</title> (formerly attributed to Augustine, as it is in this manuscript).
                    The second part has Simon of Hinton OP (d. after 1261), <title>Summa iuniorum</title>, a pastoral
                    manual of instruction in the manner of a catechism, but influenced by the <title>Sentences</title>
                    of Peter Lombard (c. 1095-1160), the <title>Speculum peccatoris</title> by the pseudo-Bernard of
                    Clairvaux, and Petrus Pictor (de Sancto Audemaro), <title>De egestate et fame</title>. The third
                    part is a collection of sermons, one of them in Middle English.</p>
