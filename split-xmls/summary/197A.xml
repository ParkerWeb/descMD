            <div xml:id="CCC197A" n="MS 197A">
                <p>CCCC MS 197A is the second part of what was, in James' time, a single volume; the other portion,
                    containing the eighth-century Gospels, is now in <ref type="ms" target="CCC197B">CCCC MS 197B</ref>.
                    CCCC MS 197A now contains sixteenth-century transcripts of King Alfred's letter to bishop Werfrithus
                    (d. 915), the trial of Joan of Arc (Robert Ciboule's <title>Tractatus</title> and accompanying
                    documents) and material relating to the treason and death of Archbishop Scrope (c. 1350-1405). The
                    rest of the manuscript is taken up with continuations of Ranulf Higden OSB (d. 1364),
                        <title>Polychronicon</title> including the unique version commonly called <title>The Westminster
                        Chronicle</title> ending in 1389 and written not long after the events it describes. This part
                    of the manuscript has been given a dating of c. 1400-25. Although the various elements of CCCC MS
                    197 were clearly assembled by Parker, nothing is known of how the medieval texts came into his
                    possession.</p>
