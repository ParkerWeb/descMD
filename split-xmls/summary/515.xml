                <p>Although recorded in the early eighteenth century by Robert Masters as being in the library of Corpus
                    Christi College amongst the Elbing manuscripts, by the time James came to catalogue the collection
                    two hundred years later the book had been lost. Possibly, like some of the other Elbing MSS it was
                    in a seriously deteriorated state and had been discarded. Masters' short notes indicate that it
                    contained Martin of Troppau OP (d. 1278), <title>Margarita decreti</title> (<title>Super
                        decreta</title>) and a document relating to the University of Paris, <title>Cartae regiae
                        concessae universitati Parisiensi</title>. If this manuscript came from Elbing the presence of
                    this second text might be explained by the documented attendance of students from Elbing at the
                    University of Paris in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries.</p>
