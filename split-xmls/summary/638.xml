                <p>This cutting from a German Missal, CCCC MS 638, was given to Corpus Christi College by Dr Robert
                    Lefever in 2007. It is the <title>Te igitur</title> initial, the opening of the Canon of the Mass,
                    and comes from a Missal made in the third quarter of the fifteenth century, probably in Swabia. The
                    iconography is of female personifications of <hi rend="italic">Ecclesia</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                        >Synagoga</hi>, with the brazen serpent, a typological symbol of the Crucifixion, wound around
                    the initial T. The pelican piercing her breast, another type of the Crucifixion and special emblem
                    of Corpus Christi College, is in the upper decorative border. The arms on this page are of the von
                    Magenbuch family, and other cuttings from the same Missal with the same arms are in collections in
                    Philadelphia and Tokyo.</p>
