                <p>CCCC MS 394, dating to c. 1300, is an illustrated Apocalypse, with the text and commentary in
                    Anglo-Norman prose, which was made in England. It was bequeathed in 1439 to the College by Thomas
                    Markaunt (c. 1382-1439), fellow, among 76 books. Only five of these books still remain in the
                    College Library; the others must have been dispersed at some time in the sixteenth century. The
                    illustrations are related to several other copies of the Anglo-Norman prose Apocalypse made in
                    England in the late thirteenth and first half of the fourteenth century. This copy is by a
                    relatively unskilled artist, whose coloured drawings are inferior to many of the other manuscripts
                    of this group.</p>
