                <p>CCCC MS 358 contains a fourteenth-century copy of a <title>Formulary</title>, a collection intended
                    to inform clerks and notaries as to the proper form to be employed when writing letters. Because
                    they featured material copied for its form rather than its particular content, letters within such
                    collections are not necessarily a sound guide to the possible provenance of the manuscripts, though
                    it should be noted that several letters in this collection are copies of letters to or from Robert,
                    bishop of Salisbury, probably Robert Wickhampton (bishop 1271-84). The provenance of this manuscript
                    remains unknown.</p>
