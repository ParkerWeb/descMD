            <div xml:id="CCC390" n="MS 390">
                <p>CCCC MS 390 is the kind of manuscript that always interested Parker. It contains the late twelfth- or
                    early thirteenth-century unique copy of <title>De uita Galfridi archiepiscopi</title> by Gerald of
                    Wales (1146-1226). As such, it surely appealed to Parker's interest both in the oldest manuscripts
                    and in those dealing with history in general, and ecclesiastical history in particular. The later
                    medieval provenance of this manuscript is evinced by a fifteenth-century contents list written by
                    'Morganus canonicus de Kermerden', whose name and hand appear in a number of manuscripts known to
                    have been in the library of the Augustinian priory of the Blessed Virgin and St John the Baptist at
                    Lanthony secunda, Gloucestershire.</p>
