            <div xml:id="CCC454" n="MS 454">
                <p>CCCC MS 454 is an important copy of the so-called 'E' redaction of the Latin texts of the medieval
                    Welsh laws. Dating from the first half of the fifteenth century, the manuscript was likely compiled
                    in North Wales, possibly within the lordship of Denbigh, and is written in an ornate Gothic hand.
                    The flyleaves contain various additions and notes in Latin and Welsh, including records of cases of
                    robbery and trespass, comments on the circumstances in which a marriage could be dissolved, and
                    notes on historical events. The manuscript also has three paper leaves which contain a printed copy
                    of <title>Ban wedy i dynny</title> (1550), an important early Protestant pamphlet, in Welsh and
                    English, on married priests.</p>
