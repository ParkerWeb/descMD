            <div xml:id="CCC117" n="MS 117">
                <p>CCCC MS 117 contains a decorated version of the text of the <title>Polychronicon</title> of Ranulf
                    Higden OSB (d. 1364) copied in the last quarter of the fourteenth century. It contains a small
                    number of marginal drawings. The text of the <title>Polychronicon</title> is littered with Parker's
                    characteristic red chalk noting items of interest such as a mention of Oxford University and church
                    affairs. In addition, the manuscript contains two items of the correspondence of Anselm of
                    Canterbury copied from <ref type="ms" target="CCC135">CCCC MS 135</ref> and an account of the
                    Primatial Council at Winchester of 1 April 1076 copied from Bodleian MS Junius 121, all in a
                    sixteenth-century hand, and with an accompanying note as to the source of the texts. It is possible
                    that these items, written on paper and added to the parchment endleaves, were copied for Parker.</p>
