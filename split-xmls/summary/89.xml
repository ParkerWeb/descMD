            <div xml:id="CCC089" n="MS 89">
                <p>This is a thirteenth-century manuscript containing commentaries by Stephen Langton (c. 1150-1228) on
                    Jeremiah, Lamentations, Ezekiel, Ezra, Nehemia, and I and II Maccabees. It belongs to the category
                    of manuscripts of Langton's works described by Lacombe and Smalley as 'collections without order'.
                    As with <ref type="ms" target="CCC031">CCCC MS 31</ref>, this collection of Langton's commentaries
                    belonged to the Savigniac and Cistercian abbey of St Mary's, Coggeshall. It is one of the few books
                    in the Parker Library to retain its original binding, a fine and well-preserved example. As a result
                    of the fragility of this binding it has only been possible to image the exterior and interior of the
                    covers and ff. 1r-9v, 234r, 235r and f. ir (back flyleaf).</p>
