            <div xml:id="CCC288" n="MS 288">
                <p>The miscellany of fourteen texts in CCCC MS 288, dating to c. 1200, has no obvious unifying theme.
                    The book opens with a number of letters of Alan of Tewkesbury OSB (d. 1202), followed by an
                    anonymous liturgical tract on church offices and a tract on the Mass by Richard the
                    Premonstratensian (fl. late twelfth century). Parts of the book contain apocrypha of the New
                    Testament such as the <title>Gospel of Nicodemus</title> and the <title>De ortu beatae Mariae et
                        infantia saluatoris</title>. Other parts contain prophetic texts such as some by Hildegard of
                    Bingen OSB (1098-1179) and the <title>De initio et fine saeculi</title> (<title>Revelations</title>)
                    of pseudo-Methodius. The book belonged to N de Sandwico (Sandwich, Kent), a monk of the cathedral
                    priory of Christ Church, Canterbury, and can perhaps be identified with an item in the early
                    fourteenth-century library catalogue by Henry of Eastry.</p>
