                <p>The <title>De pauperie Saluatoris</title> of Richard FitzRalph (d. 1360), archbishop of Armagh,
                    contained in CCCC MS 180, is a text on the poverty of the mendicants in relation to the poverty
                    taught by Christ, and the problems caused by their acquiring property and privilege. This text is
                    also in <ref type="ms" target="CCC103">CCCC MS 103</ref>. MS 180 belonged to Adam Easton OSB (c.
                    1330-97) and was probably made before 1381, perhaps at Avignon where from 1368 he had a position in
                    the papal curia, becoming a cardinal in 1381. The book later belonged to Norwich Cathedral Priory
                    where Easton had become a monk c. 1350, although he spent most of his life away from the priory at
                    Oxford University, Avignon and Rome. This book might have been made in Oxford before Adam departed
                    for Avignon.</p>
