                <p>MS 41 contains the Old English translation of Bede's <title>Ecclesiastical History</title>. This text
                    is one of those made as part of Alfred the Great's campaign to translate into English "those books
                    most necessary for men to know". MS 41 was written in the first half of the eleventh century
                    probably somewhere in the south of England. It has a colophon asking for readers' blessings on the
                    unnamed scribe. The manuscript is large in format, written in grand round script, and was obviously
                    intended to be a high-grade book. Already in the eleventh century advantage was taken of its wide
                    margins to add a variety of marginalia, ranging from the Old English poem <title>Solomon and
                        Saturn</title> to liturgical texts and Old English charms. Probably at least some of these
                    additions were made at Exeter: MS 41 was one of the manuscripts given to Exeter Cathedral by Bishop
                    Leofric (1050-72), and still contains the bilingual donation inscription cursing anyone who removed
                    it thence. The decoration of the book consists of numerous ornated initials in brown outline and a
                    drawing of Christ crucified.</p>
