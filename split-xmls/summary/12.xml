                <p>This manuscript contains the Old English translation of Gregory the Great's <title>Pastoral
                        Care</title>, with the famous preface setting out Alfred the Great's educational policy. Alfred
                    arranged for translations to be made of the texts "most necessary for men to know", and this work by
                    Gregory was probably one of the earliest to be produced. The translation claims to be the work of
                    Alfred himself, although this has sometimes been challenged. MS 12 is one of only five manuscripts
                    (and a fragment) of this work surviving from Anglo-Saxon England, and probably dates from the tenth
                    century. It is not used in the standard edition by Sweet, who based his text on the two earliest
                    manuscripts. The manuscript was certainly at Worcester in the thirteenth century, when it was
                    annotated by the 'Worcester Tremulous Hand', whose glosses and marginal notes are found in several
                    other Corpus manuscripts.</p>
