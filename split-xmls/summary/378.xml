                <p>CCCC MS 378 is a compendium of tracts on logic, dating to c. 1475-1500, very probably put together
                    for use at Cambridge University. This manuscript contains what may be the primary, and only extant,
                    copy of William Chubbes' introduction to logic, the <title>Bene fundatum</title> (<title>Introductio
                        logices</title>). Chubbes was the first Master of Jesus College, Cambridge, from 1497 to his
                    death in 1505 and perhaps it was this Cambridge connection that interested Parker in this
                    manuscript. On ff. 74v and 75r there are drawings of various sorts of 'bodies' which seem to be
                    intended to illustrate the concepts of logic in the preceding text.</p>
