            <div xml:id="CCC469" n="MS 469">
                <p>CCCC MS 469 is a late thirteenth-century manuscript containing miscellaneous texts with later
                    additions and notes down to the fifteenth century, containing what was probably a monastic
                    commonplace book compiled as an introduction or guide to matters spiritual and temporal. Thus it
                    includes the pseudonymous work attributed to Basil of Caesarea (c. 330-379), <title>Admonitio ad
                        filium spiritualem</title>, excerpts from book 12 (<title>De animalibus</title>) of Isidore of
                    Seville (d. 636), <title>Etymologiae</title>, a collection of proverbs, a French prose Brut from
                    Egbert to Edgar, extracts from the writings of Geoffrey of Monmouth (d. 1154), and a list of English
                    kings from William I to Henry V. Doubtless it was the historical material which primarily interested
                    Parker, though how and from where he acquired this manuscript is unknown.</p>
