                <p>CCCC MS 6, dating from c. 1420-40, contains the second part of John of Tynemouth's <title>Historia
                        Aurea</title> from the rule of Diocletian to the reign of Edward III, together with an anonymous
                    continuation for the years 1343-77. CCCC MS 6 was one of several manuscripts (others include CCCC
                    MSS <ref type="ms" target="CCC005">5</ref> and <ref type="ms" target="CCC007">7</ref>, BL MS
                    Lansdowne 375 and Cambridge UL MS Ee.4.20) owned and, in some cases, commissioned by William
                    Wintershill (d. c. 1435) the almoner of the Benedictine Abbey of St Albans in Hertfordshire. An
                    erased inscription in this manuscript is probably a copy of the material in <ref type="ms"
                        target="CCC005">CCCC MS 5</ref> that relates how Wintershill donated the two volumes to the
                    Abbey at his death.</p>
