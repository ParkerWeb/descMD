                <p>CCCC MS 107 is a miscellany written c. 1500, but containing one thirteenth-century quire (ff. 169-76)
                    bound in at the end. The texts contained in the volume are diverse with no apparent thematic unity.
                    Among them are Seneca's tragedies, <title>Hercules furens</title>, <title>Thyestes</title> and
                        <title>Octavia</title>, François de Meyronnes OFM (d. after 1328), <title>De
                        indulgentiis</title> and other works, an extract from Walter Map (c. 1140-1210), <title>De nugis
                        curialium</title>, extracts from Petrus Riga (d. 1209), <title>Aurora</title> (this is in the
                    thirteenth-century section) and John Duns Scotus OFM (d. 1308), <title>De perfectione
                        statuum</title>. The reason why the commissioner of the manuscript wanted such an unusual
                    collection of texts is a mystery. The annotations by Matthew Parker in various parts of the book
                    suggest that the thirteenth-century part was bound together with the c. 1500 part when the
                    manuscripts came into his collection.</p>
