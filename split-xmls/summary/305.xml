                <p>William of Nottingham's Commentary on the Gospels, contained in CCCC MS 305, is essentially a
                    commentary on the concordance of the four Gospels and derives from works such as Zacharias of
                    Besançon (Chrysopolitanus) OPrem (fl. c. 1131-60), <title>De concordia euangelistarum</title>
                        (<title>Vnum ex quatuor</title>), which is contained in <ref type="ms" target="CCC027">CCCC MS
                        27</ref>. The book has been dated to the last quarter of the fourteenth century. This William of
                    Nottingham (d. after 1330) was provincial of the English Franciscans 1316-30 and must be
                    distinguished from another William of Nottingham (d. after 1254) also a Franciscan, to whom the
                    earlier literature ascribed this work. </p>
