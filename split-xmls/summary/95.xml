                <p>CCCC MS 95 contains William of Tyre (c. 1130-c. 1186), <title>Historia rerum in partibus transmarinis
                        gestarum</title>, and Arnold of Liège OP (fl. 1290-1310), <title>Alphabetum narrationum</title>,
                    both written in a fourteenth-century hand. The <title>Historia</title> is an important source for
                    the history of the early crusading movement and the Latin kingdom of Jerusalem up to 1184, written
                    by a man who, as tutor to the 'Leper King' Baldwin IV, who later appointed William as Archbishop of
                    Tyre, was well-placed to witness events. The <title>Alphabetum narrationum</title> was one of the
                    most commonly circulated exemplum collections in medieval Europe. Written in c. 1307, it contains a
                    number of stories designed for use by preachers to illustrate or enliven sermons. The provenance of
                    this manuscript is unknown.</p>
