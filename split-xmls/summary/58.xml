                <p>CCCC MS 58 is a copy of the commentary on Ecclesiastes by Stephen Langton (c. 1150-1228), teacher,
                    theologian and archbishop of Canterbury (1207-1228). The manuscript is currently dated to the early
                    thirteenth century, and was therefore made during the lifetime of its author; the provenance is
                    unknown, but a scribal colophon locates the book to a certain 'Vallis Dei', a name common to
                    numerous religious houses in the Middle Ages. Langton's biblical commentaries have received little
                    scholarly attention compared to his sermon collections; hence CCCC MS 58 has been studied rather
                    less than other Parker Library manuscripts which contain sermons by Langton, such as <ref type="ms"
                        target="CCC450">CCCC MS 450</ref> and <ref type="ms" target="CCC459">CCCC MS 459</ref>.</p>
