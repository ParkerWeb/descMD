                <p>The commentary on the Apocalypse by Berengaudus in CCCC MS 134 was the most popular Apocalypse
                    commentary in medieval England. Many copies of English provenance survive and excerpts from the text
                    are used in most of the English illustrated Apocalypses. This book is from the Benedictine Abbey of
                    Peterborough and can probably be identified in a list of books intended for reading in the
                    refectory. On the basis of comparison of its script with other Peterborough manuscripts the dating
                    of the book is c. 1125-1150. Berengaudus is a man of whom very little is known of his dates or where
                    he was writing. The main controversy is whether he can be identified with Berengaudus of Ferrières
                    who lived in the second half of the ninth century or another Berengaudus writing in the second half
                    of the eleventh century.</p>
