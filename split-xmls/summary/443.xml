                <p>CCCC MS 443 is a late fourteenth-century manuscript of the Constitutions of Peter Quivel, Bishop of
                    Exeter (from the Exeter Synod of April 1287) and his <title>Summula Confessionis</title>. Peter
                    Quivel (c.1230–1291) is also known as Peter Quinel. The <title>Summula</title> is a reworking of the
                    confessional manual, <title>De confessione</title>, by the bishop of Worcester, Walter Cantilupe (d.
                    1266). Both texts have been published by Powicke and Cheney in their <title>Councils and
                        Synods</title>.</p>
