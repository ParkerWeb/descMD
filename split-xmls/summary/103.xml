                <p>The majority of texts in this compilation in CCCC MS 103, dating to 1425-1450, relate to
                    controversies associated with and between the mendicants. They include tracts on heresies, works
                    written in the second half of the fourteenth century by and against John Wyclif and his followers,
                    the response of St Bonaventure OFM to the Parisian master William of St Amour's criticisms of the
                    friars in the secular/mendicant controversy of the 1250s, and <title>De pauperie Saluatoris</title>
                    of Richard Fitzralph (before 1300-1360) which criticises the mendicants. Some texts in the
                    compilation do not correspond to this agenda of controversy: e.g. Uthred of Boldon OSB (c.
                    1320-1397) on the Benedictine rule.</p>
