                <p>The <title>De sacramento altaris</title> by Baldwin of Ford OCist, archbishop of Canterbury (d.
                    1190), contained in CCCC MS 200, was written in the period 1170-80. This copy was produced after he
                    became archbishop in 1184 because an historiated initial at the beginning of the text shows him
                    writing and wearing a mitre. The text discusses the biblical sources of the eucharist, foreshadowed
                    in the paschal lamb and manna of the Old Testament, and defined in the New Testament writings of
                    Saints Matthew, John and Paul. The book belonged to Christ Church cathedral priory, Canterbury.</p>
