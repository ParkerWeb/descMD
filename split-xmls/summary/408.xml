                <p>CCCC MS 408 contains a copy of John Capgrave OESA(1393–1464), <title>De illustribus Henricis</title>,
                    a historical collection established around the theme of illustrious men named Henry. It is thought
                    that this manuscript represents Capgrave's autograph version, intended for copying by scribes at the
                    Austin friars' convent at King's Lynn, and was almost certainly written in 1446-7, since it records
                    Henry VI's visit to King's Lynn in 1446 but not the death of Humphrey, duke of Gloucester, in the
                    following year. On the basis of the press mark, it has been stated that the manuscript was once at
                    the Benedictine abbey at Bury St Edmunds, although this has been disputed. It has also been argued
                    that this manuscript was once in the collection of the historian, John Bale (1495-1563).</p>
