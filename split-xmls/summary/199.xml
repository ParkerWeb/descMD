                <p>CCCC MS 199 is a copy of Augustine of Hippo, <title>De trinitate</title>, made c. 1090 at Llanbadarn
                    Fawr by Ieuan ap Sulien (d. 1137). Ieuan was from a prominent literary family; his brother,
                    Rhigyfarch (d. 1099), wrote a Life of St David and succeeded his father, Sulien (d. 1091), as bishop
                    of St David's. Some of Ieuan's own verses in Latin and Welsh survive in the margins of this
                    manuscript, but unfortunately part of the Welsh verse was lost in 1953 when the manuscript was
                    rebound. The main text of this manuscript is written in a very attractive hand, with some beautiful
                    decorated initials. The flyleaf contains a ninth-century fragment of Smaragdus (fl. 809-17) in a
                    Carolingian minuscule, possibly from Rheims.</p>
