            <div xml:id="CCC031" n="MS 31">
                <p>CCCC MS 31 is a thirteenth-century manuscript containing a copy of the Commentary on the Twelve Minor
                    Prophets by Stephen Langton (c. 1150-1228), which originally belonged to the Savigniac and
                    Cistercian abbey of St Mary's, Coggeshall, along with <ref type="ms" target="CCC089">CCCC MS
                        89</ref>. Stephen's work on the minor prophets has received little scholarly attention in
                    comparison to his sermons. The manuscript also contains a late twelfth-century fragment of the
                    pseudo-Clementine Recognitions.</p>
