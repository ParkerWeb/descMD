                <p>CCCC MS 236 contains Martial's epigrams, as well as some added medieval epigrams by Hubert Walter (d.
                    1205) and others. It was written in the thirteenth century. It is one of the Corpus manuscripts
                    which contains the signature of Daniel Rogers (c. 1539-91), an Elizabethan diplomat and the son of
                    one of Foxe's martyrs. It is not known how some of Rogers' books came into the possession of Corpus
                    Christi. Like several of Rogers' books it contains a price mark.</p>
