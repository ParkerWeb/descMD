                <p>Richard Rolle of Hampole (c. 1305-49) wrote commentaries on the Psalms in both Latin and English, of
                    which CCCC MS 387 contains that in English. <ref type="ms" target="CCC365">CCCC MS 365</ref>
                    contains his Latin version. The text of the Psalms is in Latin with each verse followed by the
                    English commentary. This copy, dating from c. 1425, contains fine decoration of illuminated
                    ornamental borders and initials, and is notable for its very large size. It belonged to the
                    Augustinian Abbey of Lessness (Kent).</p>
