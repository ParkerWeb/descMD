            <div xml:id="CCC342" n="MS 342">
                <p>CCCC MS 342 demonstrates that Matthew Parker was not solely concerned to acquire original copies of
                    manuscript material that interested him, but that he actively sought to propagate new copies of
                    texts. This manuscript contains a version of the <title>Flores historiarum</title> (<title>Annales
                        ecclesiae Roffensis</title>) with a particular emphasis on events in Rochester, sometimes
                    attributed to Edmund of Haddenham OSB (fl. c. 1300), a monk of Rochester or John of Rainham OSB (d.
                    1294), prior of Rochester. This text was copied, on Parker's instructions, directly from BL Cotton
                    Nero D.II, itself in the hands of Parker's secretary, John Joscelin (1529-1603) at the time.
                    Parker's characteristic red chalk underlining in this volume reveals his interest in the subject of
                    clerical marriage, a matter of more than public and historical interest to the Archbishop of
                    Canterbury who was, despite Queen Elizabeth I's objections, a married man.</p>
