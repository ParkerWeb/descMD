                <p>CCCC MS 482 contains a collection of English statutes (or what are commonly held to be statutes,
                    which includes such material as early writs and royal letters) copied in the late fourteenth or
                    early fifteenth century. At some stage in the manuscript's history, probably before the
                    mid-eighteenth century, it was disbound and rebound in a terribly confused order, though a later
                    index of the material contained within it allows the codex's contents to be navigated. This
                    manuscript was not part of Parker's collection; rather, it was donated to Corpus Christi by one J.
                    Moore, possibly to be identified with John Moore, a graduate of the college in 1756.</p>
