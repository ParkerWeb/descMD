                <p>CCCC MS 177 is a miscellany of over fifty moral and other tracts copied in the second half of the
                    fifteenth century. The material ranges from the pseudo-Senecan <title>Formula uitae
                    honestae</title>, now commonly attributed to Martin of Braga (c. 515-80), a group of Aesop's
                        <title>Fables</title>, poems once attributed to Walter Map (c. 1140-1210 such as
                        <title>Disputatio inter cor et oculum</title>, and a Latin translation of Abu al-Malik ibn Ali
                    al-Ala Ibn Zuhr's <title>De regimine sanitatis</title>. Walter Map's <title>Epistola Valerii ad
                        Rufinum ne uxorem ducat</title> is accompanied in this manuscript by a <title>Commentary</title>
                    on the <title>Epistola</title> by John Ridewall OFM (d. after 1340). It has been conjectured that
                    this manuscript was once in the possession of the historian John Bale (1495-1563), from whom it may
                    have passed to Parker, but this is not certainly established.</p>
