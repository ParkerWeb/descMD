                <p>CCCC MS 303 is an interesting witness to the fate of the Old English language after the Norman
                    Conquest led to the replacement of much of the English elite with French-speaking Normans.
                    Manuscripts of Old English homilies were still produced at least as frequently as they had been in
                    the period before the Conquest; contrary to popular misconception Old English seems to have
                    continued in use. MS 303 is a collection of Old English homilies, many of them by Ælfric of Eynsham
                    (c. 950-c. 1010), copied in the first half of the twelfth century in the south east of England,
                    probably at Rochester. An old foliation shows that several quires have been lost from the start of
                    this manuscript. Parker gave it the number 9 in his collection of homiletic manuscripts.</p>
