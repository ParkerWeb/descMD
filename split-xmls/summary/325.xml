                <p>CCCC MS 325, written in the fourteenth century, contains a number of elevating treatises on a range
                    of subjects, including those by Vincent of Beauvais OP (1189/94-1264) on the education of children
                    written for the French royal family, <title>De eruditione regalium filiorum</title>, and on facing
                    death, <title>Liber consolatorius ad Ludouicum regem de morte filii</title>. There is also a copy of
                    the advice of Bernard of Clairvaux OCist (1090-1153) on the interpretation of the Benedictine Rule -
                        <title>De praecepto et dispensatione</title>, and his <title>Epistola ad Robertum nepotem
                        suum</title> . The manuscript, copied in a late thirteenth or early fourteenth-century hand, was
                    certainly once in the library of the cathedral priory at Norwich, though mention of the name John de
                    Stratton on the first folio of the codex almost certainly refers to the man who was appointed prior
                    of Norwich's daughter house of St. Mary Magdalen, St. Margaret, and All Virgin Saints at King's Lynn
                    in 1325. The manuscript may have passed through the hands of the historian, John Bale (1495-1563),
                    before it passed into Parker's collection.</p>
