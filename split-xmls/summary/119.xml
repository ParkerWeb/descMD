                <p>MS 119 is predominantly a collection of letters. Most of the letters are either written to or by
                    European Reformation leaders but a few are entirely English such as the autograph letter of Edward
                    VI to Catherine Parr and the autograph letter of Anne Boleyn to her father, Sir Thomas Boleyn. The
                    volume also contains a few additional brief pieces such as a copy of Martin Bucer's will, a copy of
                    the Articles of unanimity in faith signed at Karlstadt, 1539 and also an English version of Thomas
                    Gray's Preface to the Scala Chronica (original in <ref type="ms" target="CCC133">CCCC MS
                    133</ref>).</p>
