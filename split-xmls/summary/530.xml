                <p>CCCC MS 530 contains two medical tracts: the <title>Canon medicinae</title> by Avicenna (Abu 'Ali
                    al-Husain ibn 'Abdallah Ibn Sina) translated into Latin by Gerard of Cremona (c. 1114-87), and the
                        <title>De accidenti et morbo</title> by Galen (129-99). The manuscript was written in Germany in
                    1398 and contains many ornamental initials. It has lost its binding. It is part of the Elbing
                    collection, a group of manuscripts which belonged to a Brigittine convent at Elbing (Elblag), near
                    Gdansk. The collection was donated to Corpus Christi College by either Richard Pernham (1583?-1628)
                    or his wife Mary, whose name is in many of these books.</p>
