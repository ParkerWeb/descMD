                <p>CCCC MS 222, which originally formed one volume with <ref type="ms" target="CCC226">CCCC MS
                    226</ref>, contains two religious tracts, on the conception of Mary and the conception of Christ,
                    both of which are attributed to Richard of Saint-Victor OSA (d. 1173). There are various later
                    pencil notes and additions. The manuscript belonged to Hugh of Girune (d. after 1239), a monk of
                    Christ Church, Canterbury, who donated it to that house, as attested by the inscription on f.ir,
                        <title>Liber Hugonis de Girunde de penitentia Magdalene</title>. This folio was originally the
                    title page of <ref type="CCC226">CCCC MS 226</ref>.</p>
