            <div xml:id="CCC310" n="MS 310">
                <p>This is a late twelfth-century copy of Hugh of Saint-Victor OSA (c. 1096-1141), <title>De sacramentis
                        christianae fidei</title> written c. 1134; this was one of the earliest complete theological
                    works of the Paris schools and one of Hugh's most important and influential works. CCCC MS 310 is
                    one of many surviving manuscript copies. The text is written in a fine, small hand and there are a
                    number of initials, including some fine figure and ornamental initials on gold grounds.
                    Unfortunately some of the margins of the manuscript are damaged, as it has been gnawed by mice or
                    rats.</p>
