                <p>CCCC MS 337, dating to the fourteenth century, contains two main texts. The first is the <title>Liber
                        scintillarum</title> of Defensor of Ligugé (late seventh century), a florilegium of biblical and
                    patristic sayings arranged according to themes. The second is the <title>Summa Qui bene
                        praesunt</title> by Richard of Wetheringsett (fl. c. 1200-30), first recorded chancellor of
                    Cambridge University at some time between 1215 and 1232. This is a guide for preachers structured in
                    the manner of a catechism according to the Creed, the Lord's Prayer etc. It is one of the earliest
                    pastoral texts of this sort which were initiated by the reforms of the Fourth Lateran Council of
                    1215. Formerly the author of this text was thought to be William de Montibus (d. 1213). The book
                    might have belonged to the cathedral priory of Christ Church, Canterbury, but that provenance is
                    doubtful.</p>
