                <p>As an important witness to the twelfth-century interest in texts of classical Roman and late antique
                    authors, CCCC MS 71 contains Macrobius, Saturnalia, Macrobius's commentary on Cicero's Somnium
                    Scipionis, and Apuleius, Opera philosophica. The Apuleius texts belong to the third group of
                    manuscripts of these works as classified by Beaujeu. The added thirteenth-century list of contents
                    on the flyleaf is in a special form characteristic of the Abbey of St Albans. It is likely that the
                    book was made at the abbey, although there is no firm evidence it was there until the thirteenth
                    century when the contents were listed. Thomson, in his study of St Albans manuscripts, dates the
                    book to c. 1150. On the flyleaf a fifteenth-century note values the book at xx s.</p>
