            <div xml:id="CCC457" n="MS 457">
                <p> CCCC MS 457 is an early twelfth-century copy of the second recension of Alexander of Canterbury OSB
                    (fl. early twelfth century), <title>Liber ex dictis beati Anselmi</title>, including the
                        <title>Miracula</title>. The scholarly circle around Anselm (archbishop of Canterbury 1093-1109)
                    produced several writings which contain material derived from the archbishop's own teachings, of
                    which this is one. This manuscript was used by the editors to provide the base text for the second
                    recension. It has early provenance at Christ Church, Canterbury in the form of an erased <hi
                        rend="italic">ex libris</hi> inscription and a classmark in the early form ".AN.". It later came
                    into the hands of Matthew Parker, who rewrote some parts and provided an inscription erroneously
                    attributing the work to Eadmer of Canterbury OSB (d. after 1124).</p>
