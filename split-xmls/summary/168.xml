                <p>CCCC MS 168 contains a miscellany of sixteenth-century transcriptions of a wide variety of written
                    work including letters, speeches, prayers, poems, proverbs, historical notes, Anglo-Saxon laws and
                    more. The volume is commonly associated with Bishop Richard Cox of Ely (c.1500-81) who also served
                    as tutor and then as almoner to Henry VIII's son, Edward. As M. R. James points out, W. Stanley's
                    identification of this manuscript as Parker's 'Misc Y' is inaccurate. This volume was, in fact,
                    donated by Dr John Jegon, probably after 1600.</p>
