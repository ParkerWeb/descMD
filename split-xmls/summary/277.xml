            <div xml:id="CCC277" n="MS 277">
                <p>CCCC MS 277 contains the unique surviving copy of Adam of Barking's <title>Carmen de serie sex
                        aetatum</title>, a poem narrating and commenting on biblical history. The copy in this
                    manuscript is incomplete, dealing with only four of the six ages alluded to in the title, and is
                    almost certainly Barking's (fl. twelfth century) own working copy. The Tudor antiquarian John Leland
                    (1506-52) records that he saw a copy of the same work in Sherborne Abbey in Dorset, though it has
                    been disputed that this is the same manuscript as the one now in Corpus Christi and, as a result, it
                    is not certain how this manuscript came to be in Parker's collection.</p>
