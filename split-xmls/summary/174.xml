                <p>CCCC MS 174, dating to c. 1420, contains a version of the Middle English prose Brut chronicle
                    sometimes defined as the 'Common Version' to 1377. As such it represents another manuscript that
                    demonstrates Parker's interest in British history, attested by a note in his own hand referring to a
                    similar text in <ref type="ms" target="CCC182">CCCC MS 182</ref>. Another sixteenth-century hand has
                    added a note to the effect that this text served as the model for William Caxton's <title>Fructus
                        temporum</title>. The version of the text as preserved in this manuscript was used as the basis
                    for the edition of the Brut for the years 1333 to 1377 edited by F. W. D. Brie in 1908. Its
                    provenance is unknown.</p>
