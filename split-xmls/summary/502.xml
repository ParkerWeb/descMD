                <p>This book is in an extremely fragile condition and it has not been possible for it to be imaged, save
                    for a few images of its cover and two single pages. The front cover exterior and interior, the recto
                    of the front flyleaf, f. ar, and the first leaf, f. br have been imaged. The paper is disintegrating
                    and cannot be stabilised, so it has not even been possible to foliate the manuscript throughout.
                    There is a single text in the book, the <title>Rationale diuinorum officiorum</title> by William
                    Durandus the Elder (1237-96), the long discussion of the liturgical services of the Church which was
                    very widely read in the late Middle Ages. This volume is part of the Elbing collection; a group of
                    manuscripts which belonged to a Brigittine convent at Elbing (Elblag), near Gdansk. The collection
                    was donated to Corpus Christi College by either Richard Pernham (1583?-1628) or his wife Mary, whose
                    name is in many of these books.</p>
