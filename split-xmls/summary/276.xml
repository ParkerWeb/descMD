                <p>CCCC MS 276 is a witness to the cultural influences at work at St Augustine's Abbey, Canterbury, in
                    the first generations after the Norman Conquest. It contains two separate volumes which have been
                    together since the twelfth century: the first was written in the late eleventh century and contains
                    the <title>Historia Romana</title>, a version of Eutropius' <title>Breuiarium ab urbe
                        condita</title> by Paul the Deacon (c. 720/30-99); the second was written circa 1100 and
                    contains the <title>De moribus et actis primorum Normanniae ducum</title> (<title>Historia
                        Normannorum</title>) of Dudo of Saint-Quentin (c. 960-1026). Both were made at St Augustine's.
                    The first volume contains the work of two co-operating scribes, one writing an angular Norman hand,
                    the other the round exaggerated Anglo-Caroline typical of St Augustine's at this date.
                    Mont-St-Michel influence has been detected in the initials. The manuscript was owned by a certain
                    William Carye before Parker acquired it.</p>
