            <div xml:id="CCC279" n="MS 279">
                <p>CCCC MS 279 is a significant source for the study of the development and transmission of early
                    medieval canon collections. The manuscript was written in north-west France, in the late ninth or
                    early tenth century, in a script derived from Tours. The book was in England by c. 1000 and has a
                    later medieval provenance at Worcester. The textual content of the manuscript is derived from Irish
                    and Breton sources; the contents include the only extant copy of the canons of the 'First Synod of
                    Patrick', a copy of the <title>Liber ex lege Moysi</title>, whose Irish connections are the subject
                    of some debate, and a copy of the <title>Collectio canonum Hibernensis</title>. The manuscript is
                    particularly important as a witness to the Breton, and later English, transmission of the
                        <title>Collectio</title>. There are additional glosses in Breton and Old Irish, although the
                    latter were copied into the manuscript by a Breton scribe, resulting in some orthographical
                    confusion.</p>
