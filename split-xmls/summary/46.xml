            <div xml:id="CCC046" n="MS 46">
                <p>CCCC MS 46 contains copies of two works by John of Salisbury (c. 1120-1180), the
                        <title>Policraticus</title> and the <title>Metalogicon</title>. The Corpus manuscript is
                    sometimes described as the author's own copy that was presented by Salisbury to Archbishop Thomas
                    Becket. Whether this was the case or not, it was certainly at the Benedictine cathedral priory of
                    the Holy Trinity, Christ Church, Canterbury in the later twelfth century and remained there until it
                    came into Parker's possession. Nineteenth- and early twentieth-century editors and commentators
                    stressed the importance of the texts in this manuscript as early versions of John of Salisbury's
                    work. A more recent editor, however, has described the texts preserved in CCCC MS 46 as
                    'corrupt'.</p>
