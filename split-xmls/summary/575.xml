                <p>The main condition attached to Parker’s gift of books to Corpus Christi College was an annual
                    inspection of the library by officials from Trinity Hall and Gonville and Caius College. To this end
                    three copies were made of the Parker Register, listing Parker’s donations, one for each college, so
                    that the contents of the library could be checked against this list. CCCC MS 575 is the copy
                    belonging to Corpus Christi College, and contains annotations made by John Parker, Corpus fellow and
                    son of Matthew, who checked the books not long after his father’s death. It is not clear how
                    thoroughly these annual inspections were carried out - for one thing the three copies differ
                    slightly - but nonetheless the system was successful in that remarkably little of Parker’s
                    collection has been lost over the years. The 'audit' has been revived as an annual occurrence since
                    2004 after a long period when it did not regularly take place.</p>
