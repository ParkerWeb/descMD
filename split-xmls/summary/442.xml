                <p>This manuscript contains a miscellaneous canon law collection, made circa 1100 or in the early
                    twelfth century on the Continent, probably at Arras, Thérouanne, or somewhere in the region of North
                    France. It contains 650 canons of a miscellaneous variety, perhaps derived from a 'long version' of
                    pseudo-Isidore's Decretals. Its small size suggests that it might have been someone's personal
                    working collection. It seems to end incomplete as it stands, suggesting that there were originally
                    more than ten quires in the manuscript. Parker, or one of his circle, wrote "por" on the first page,
                    perhaps a clue to its provenance; James noted that this mark is also found in <ref type="ms"
                        target="CCC323">CCCC MS 323</ref> and the second volume of <ref type="ms" target="CCC308">CCCC
                        MS 308</ref>, but neither of these has recorded provenance before Parker.</p>
