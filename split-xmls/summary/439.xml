                <p>CCCC MS 439 consists of two volumes of the fourteenth century later bound together. The first
                    contains the <title>Compotus correctorius</title> of Robert Grosseteste (d. 1253), one of three
                    tracts attributed to him on the subject of the computus, that is on the reckoning of time and dates,
                    particularly in regard to the Church year. The second volume contains three texts not thematically
                    connected: the <title>Liber scintillarum</title> of Defensor of Ligugé (late 7th century), a
                    florilegium of biblical and patristic sayings arranged according to themes, also in <ref type="ms"
                        target="CCC337">CCCC MS 337</ref>; Isidore of Seville (c. 560-636), <title>De ortu et obitu
                        patrum</title>; Honorius Augustodunensis (fl. first half of twelfth century),
                        <title>Elucidarius</title> (<title>Elucidarium</title>), also in <ref type="ms" target="CCC308"
