                <p>CCCC MS 259 is one of several copies of the <title>Polychronicon</title> by Ranulf Higden OSB (d.
                    1364), a monk of St Werburga's Abbey, Chester, owned by Parker, and reflecting the latter's interest
                    in British history. The version of this chronicle contained in this manuscript ends in 1338 and was
                    copied not long after the last events it describes in the mid-fourteenth century. The
                        <title>Polychronicon</title> was the most widely read chronicle in late medieval England, and
                    exists in many manuscripts, other copies being <ref type="ms" target="CCC021">CCCC MSS 21</ref>,
                        <ref type="ms" target="CCC117">117</ref>, <ref type="ms" target="CCC164">164</ref>, and in
                    English translation in <ref type="ms" target="CCC354">CCCC MS 354</ref> . It has on the front
                    flyleaf a note by the historian John Bale (1495-1563), attributing the text to 'Roger of Chester', a
                    figure sometimes supposed to have written the <title>Polychronicon</title> until Higden's identity
                    was confirmed in the nineteenth century. The provenance of the manuscript is unknown.</p>
