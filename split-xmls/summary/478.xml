                <p>The Armenian psalter, probably dating from the thirteenth century, contained in CCCC MS 478, is one
                    of the most curious items in the collection. Parker was in correspondence with Bishop Davies of St
                    David's and his collaborator, William Salesbury, regarding the language in which the text was
                    written. The list of Parker's books in the Parker Register (<ref type="MS" target="CCC575">CCCC MS
                        575</ref>) is annotated to record that it had been identified as Armenian by William Patten (d.
                    in or after 1598). Patten produced in 1570 a vocabulary and alphabet in Armenian for which he had
                    made use of this psalter. In the middle of the book are three coloured pictures of the Virgin and
                    Child, the Crucifixion, and Christ surrounded by the Evangelist symbols.</p>
