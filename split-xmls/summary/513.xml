            <div xml:id="CCC513" n="MS 513">
                <p>CCCC 513 contains an early fifteenth-century collection of sermons for the whole of the liturgical
                    year, probably written in Germany. Another manuscript of the collection, Munich, University Library
                    MS 2°. 127, bears the label ‘<hi rend="italic">Sermones magistri Hermanni de Lipczik</hi>’. The
                    otherwise unknown but possibly Franciscan Hermannus may be the author or the compiler of the
                    collection. The book retains its contemporary binding with straps, clasps and bosses. This volume is
                    part of the Elbing collection; a group of manuscripts which belonged to a Brigittine convent at
                    Elbing (Elblag), near Gdansk which was founded in 1458 and deserted in 1521. Almost all the Elbing
                    manuscripts contain the ownership inscription of Mary Pernham, wife of Richard Pernham (d. 1628),
                    Fellow of the college and <hi rend="italic">pastor Anglicus</hi> of St Marien church in Elbing from
                    1618-24.</p>
