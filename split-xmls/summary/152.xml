                <p>CCCC MS 152 contains two distinct sections. The first on vellum, dating from the middle years of the
                    fifteenth century, consists of the <title>Annales sex regum Angliae</title> of Nicholas Trevet OP
                    (c. 1258-c. 1334), a legal text by the canon lawyer, Iacobus de Theramo (Giacomo Palladini) (c.
                    1350-1417), <title>Consolatio peccatorum</title>, also known as the <title>Processus Belial</title>,
                    a list of English kings to Henry VI and a collection of miracles and other scriptural tales. The
                    second section is made up of a series of letters on paper between late fifteenth and early sixteenth
                    century continental religious humanists, including Robert Gaguin OTrin (d. 1501), Johannes
                    Trithemius OSB, abbot of Sponsheim (1462-1516), Mattheus Herbenus, chaplain of St Servatus,
                    Maastricht, John Paleonydorus OCarm (1433-1507) and Arnoldus Bostius OCarm (1466-99). The manuscript
                    contains material in the hand of the historian John Bale (1495-1563), and it is possible that Bale,
                    himself a former Carmelite, put the two distinct volumes together before it passed, along with other
                    manuscripts in his collection, to Parker.</p>
