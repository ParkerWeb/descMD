                <p>CCCC MS 96, dating to c. 1425-50, contains the text of a chronicle from the arrival in England of St
                    Augustine of Canterbury up to 1199, together with a collection of Latin versions of the Anglo-Saxon
                    law codes known as the <title>Quadripartitus</title>. The version of the
                        <title>Quadripartitus</title> is one of three (the other versions being in Manchester, John
                    Rylands University Library MS Lat. 420 and London, BL MS Additional 49366) that make up a coherent
                    tradition within the transmission of the text. The chronicle was once commonly called <title>John
                        Brompton's Chronicle</title> but is probably better described as <title>The Fitzhugh
                        Chronicle</title>, since the arms of William, 4th lord Fitzhugh (1425-1452), depicted in a
                    gilded initial, probably identify him as the first owner. Thereafter it was in the hands of John
                    Brompton (fl. 1436-c. 1464), Abbot of Jervaulx and possibly Richard, Duke of Gloucester (d. 1485).
                    John Leland (d. 1552), the antiquary, seems to have seen the volume in Jervaulx Abbey in the 1530s
                    or early 1540s, but it was recorded by the historian John Bale (1495-1563) as being in the hands of
                    Peter Osborn (d. 1592) Keeper of the Privy Purse to Edward VI and Parker's executor, from whom it
                    passed to Parker.</p>
