                <p>CCCC MS 444 is a c. 1300-25 copy of the Middle English Genesis and Exodus, a biblical paraphrase in
                    verse written c. 1250, and derived from the <title>Historia scholastica</title> by Petrus Comestor
                    (d. c. 1187). It is considered to be in an East Midlands dialect and is the earliest English
                    paraphrase from the <title>Historia scholastica</title>. The title is misleading because the text
                    also contains paraphrases of sections of Leviticus, Deuteronomy and Numbers. The vocabulary and
                    syntax of the text has been much studied by philologists of early Middle English dialects.</p>
