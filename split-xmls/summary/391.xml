                <p>CCCC MS 391 is a portiforium, that is a Breviary, from Worcester. It contains a large variety of
                    material, including a psalter and prognostical texts. It was written at a time when the various
                    elements of the divine office were drawn together into a single book, the Breviary. This book
                    represents the text in a primitive form. In the late Middle Ages it was associated with St Oswald,
                    bishop of Worcester and archbishop of York, who died in 992. However, the calendar has Oswald's name
                    in the original hand, and the script dates the manuscript later, as was first pointed out by
                    Parker's secretary John Joscelyn (1529-1603). It is now known as the <title>Portiforium of St
                        Wulfstan</title>, after Wulfstan, bishop of Worcester 1062-95, not to be confused with Wulfstan
                    the homilist (d. 1023). It is usually dated to the late 1060s. At the beginning of the psalter there
                    is a framed tinted drawing of David harping and a large ornamental initial for the first psalm.</p>
