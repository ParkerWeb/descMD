            <div xml:id="CCC184" n="MS 184">
                <p>CCCC MS 184 contains a twelfth-century copy of Eusebius of Caesarea (c. 260-c. 340) <title>Historia
                        ecclesiastica</title> in the Latin translation by Rufinus, an important source of early
                    Christian history. Although the book may have been copied at the cathedral priory of Christ Church,
                    Canterbury, not long after that it was recorded in the library catalogue of the cathedral priory of
                    St Andrew in Rochester. It was almost certainly copied from an earlier Christ Church copy of the
                    same text (<ref type="ms" target="CCC187">CCCC MS 187</ref> copied c. 1100), since both manuscripts
                    share a common omission from Book XI of the <title>Historia</title>. It is one of several
                    manuscripts from Rochester priory in Parker's collection.</p>
