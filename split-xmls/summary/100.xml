                <p>CCCC MS 100 contains sixteenth-century transcripts, predominantly of medieval texts. Of particular
                    interest is the transcript of Asser's <title>De rebus gestis Ælfredi regis</title> which was
                    transcribed from London, BL MS Cotton Otho A. XII, a manuscript which was destroyed by a fire in Sir
                    Robert Cotton's library in 1731. Asser (d. 909), was the bishop of Sherborne and several works
                    ascribed to him survive. His account of King Alfred is of particular importance as one of the main
                    historical sources for Alfred's reign. MS 100 also contains a copy of a Middle English tract, 'On
                    translating the Bible into English', which was published in 1530 and frequently thereafter. More
                    scholarly attention has been paid to the copy of this tract in <ref type="ms" target="CCC298">CCCC
                        MS 298</ref>, item 25.</p>
