                <p><title>Ancrene Wisse</title> or <title>Ancrene Riwle</title> is a treatise on the religious life
                    intended for anchoresses or nuns, written in the first half of the thirteenth century. There is much
                    controversy as to when, where and by whom it was written, but possibly it was by a Dominican writing
                    in the West Midlands in the 1230s. Others have argued for authorship by an Augustinian canon, also
                    writing in the West Midlands in the first third of the century. CCCC MS 402, once considered to be
                    one of the earliest versions of the text, is now thought to be of the late thirteenth century. The
                    MS has recently been published in an authoritative new edition by Bella Millett, collated with
                    variants from all other MSS of the text.</p>
