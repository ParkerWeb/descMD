                <p>CCCC MS 328 consists of two volumes, both hagiographical in nature. The first was written circa 1100,
                    perhaps at Christ Church, Canterbury, and concerns St Dunstan, archbishop of Canterbury 959-88. As
                    well as the <title>Vita</title> by Osbern of Canterbury OSB (d. 1094?), it contains a Mass of St
                    Dunstan with a neumed prosa and an extract from the Life of St Dunstan by Eadmer of Canterbury OSB
                    (d. after 1124). The second volume contains material on Cluniac saints, specifically the Lives of
                    Odo, Maiolus, and Odilo, and a Mass for Odilo. It was written in the first half of the twelfth
                    century. The two volumes were certainly together in the later Middle Ages, when an ownership
                    inscription of St Swithun's cathedral priory, Winchester with a contents list was entered on a
                    flyleaf.</p>
