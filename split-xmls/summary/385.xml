                <p>CCCC MS 385 consists of four separate volumes of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries which have
                    been bound together. The first part is a tract on the sins of monks which analyses the doubts and
                    temptations which confront a monk. Part two is written at St Albans in his own hand by Matthew Paris
                    OSB (d. 1259) and contains William of Conches (c. 1080-1154), <title>Dragmaticon</title>, with some
                    diagrams drawn by Matthew Paris. This manuscript has been used in the edition of the
                        <title>Dragmaticon</title> by Ronca. The third part, dating to c. 1400, has a Middle English
                    sermon based on Richard of Saint-Victor OSA (d. 1173), <title>Beniamin minor</title> and other short
                    Middle English devotional texts. The fourth part contains the apocryphal gospel, the
                        <title>Euangelium Nicodemi</title>, and some exempla and stories. Although at the beginning of
                    the first part there is an early sixteenth-century inscription of ownership of a monk of Canterbury,
                    this may be false, and the book cannot be identified in the catalogues of any of the Canterbury
                    monasteries.</p>
