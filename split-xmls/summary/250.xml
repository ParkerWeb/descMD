                <p>CCCC MS 250, dating from the early sixteenth century, contains one of around ten surviving
                    manuscripts of Walter of Guisborough's <title>Chronicle</title> which covers the period 1048-1305,
                    with a continuation 1305-12, probably by an anonymous Durham continuator. Walter of Guisborough (fl.
                    c.1290–c.1305) (also known as Walter 'of Hemingford' or 'of Hemingburgh') was an Augustinian canon
                    of the priory of St Mary at Guisborough. The early portion of the chronicle draws heavily on the
                    chronicle of William of Newburgh OSA (d. after 1199), the <title>Historia post Bedam</title> and
                    other northern sources. The roughly contemporary portion of the chronicle shows some similarities to
                    other Northern histories of the period but is considered to be an independent chronicle. The
                    chronicle tends to be more accurate regarding events in the north of England than in the south.</p>
