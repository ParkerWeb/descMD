                <p>CCCC MS 348 is another instance of Parker not simply collecting original manuscript versions of texts
                    he regarded as important, but actually creating new copies of them. This codex contains two distinct
                    texts, one, the <title>Chronica minora</title> of Matthew Paris OSB (c. 1195-1259), is copied from
                    the version of the same text now in BL Royal 14.C.VII. The same manuscript was used as the basis for
                    a much fuller transcription now in <ref type="ms" target="CCC056">CCCC MS 56</ref>. The second text
                    in this manuscript is a transcription of a number of Anglo-Saxon law codes from Alfred to Cnut
                    copied from the version of the so-called <title>Quadripartitus</title> collection in <ref type="ms"
                        target="CCC096">CCCC MS 96</ref>. Both texts reveal Parker's interest in English history, and in
                    particular in the Saxon origins of the English state and society.</p>
