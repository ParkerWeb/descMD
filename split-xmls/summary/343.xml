                <p>CCCC MS 343 contains fourteenth-century copies of historical material of the kind that interested
                    Parker. In this instance the texts include Ralph Niger (d. c. 1210), to whose
                        <title>Chronicum</title>, covering the period from the Creation to 1199, has been added extracts
                    from the <title>Chronicon Anglicanum</title> by Ralph of Coggeshall OCist (d. after 1224), and a
                    copy of Coggeshall's <title>Chronicon terrae sanctae et de captis a Saladino Hierosolymis</title>.
                    In addition, the manuscript contains a handful of other texts of a varied nature, including verses
                    on weights and measures, a guide to playing chess, a gospel parody (<title>Sequencia leti euuangelii
                        secundum lucrum</title>) and a short history of the dukes of Normandy from William I to John.
                    The flyleaves of the volume are made up of two leaves of a late fifteenth-century abstract version
                    of the <title>Polychronicon</title> by Ranulf Higden OSB (d. 1364). Nothing is known of the
                    provenance of this manuscript.</p>
