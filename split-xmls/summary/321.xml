            <div xml:id="CCC321" n="MS 321">
                <p>CCCC MS 321 is a fourteenth-century manuscript of Petrus Iohannis Olivi OFM (1247/8-96),
                        <title>Commentary on Matthew</title> and <title>Quaestiones</title>. The texts of these have not
                    been printed, save for extracts. The manuscript has been associated with the Benedictine abbey of
                    Ramsey, but on evidence which Ker thought insufficient. It also contains an important
                    eleventh-century fragment of an Old English dialogue about the word Alleluia, otherwise attested
                    only in BL Harley 3271, and probably based on material from the pseudo-Bedan
                        <title>Collectanea</title>. It is not clear whether Parker placed this fragment in the book, or
                    whether it was already there when he acquired it.</p>
