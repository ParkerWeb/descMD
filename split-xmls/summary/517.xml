                <p>This book is in an extremely fragile condition and it has not been possible for it to be imaged, save
                    for the exterior of its front and back covers. The paper is disintegrating and cannot be stabilised,
                    so it has not even been possible to foliate the manuscript throughout. The manuscript, either German
                    or Bohemian, dates to the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries and is part of the Elbing collection; a
                    group of manuscripts which belonged to a Brigittine convent at Elbing (Elblag), near Gdansk. The
                    collection was donated to Corpus Christi College by Richard Pernham (1583?-1628) or by his wife,
                    Mary, whose signature is in many of the books. The main part of the text contains sermons attributed
                    to Thomas Aquinas OP (1224/5-74). There is also an unidentified set of <hi rend="italic"
                        >quaestiones</hi> on the <title>Sentences</title> of Peter Lombard (c. 1095-1160).</p>
