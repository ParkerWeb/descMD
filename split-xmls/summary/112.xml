                <p>CCCC MS 112 is a manuscript that reflects Parker's interest in alchemy, a subject of great interest
                    to many of his contemporaries. The codex, written in the second half of the fifteenth century,
                    contains a number of texts attributed to Ramón Lull (1232?-1315), though in practice many of these
                    cannot be shown to have been written by him. It is illustrated by large drawings greater and smaller
                    than half-page of alchemical instruments and furnaces. Similar but much smaller drawings occur in
                    some margins. It is not known how this manuscript came to be in Parker's collection. </p>
