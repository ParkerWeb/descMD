                <p>This book is in an extremely fragile condition and it has not been possible for it to be imaged, save
                    for the front and back cover exteriors, and the first gathering rectos only foliated as ff. a-l. The
                    paper is in a very poor state and cannot be stabilised, so it has not even been possible to foliate
                    the manuscript throughout. CCCC MS 527, made in the fourteenth century in Bohemia or Germany,
                    contains three texts: an alphabetical moral dictionary, a treatise on penance attributed either to
                    Thomas of Chobham (d. after 1233) or more likely to Bartholomaeus de S. Concordio Pisanus OP (d.
                    1347), and finally <title>De essentia dei</title> by pseudo-Jerome. The work on penance has a
                    colophon dating its writing to 1395. This volume is part of the Elbing collection; a group of
                    manuscripts which belonged to a Brigittine convent at Elbing (Elblag), near Gdansk. The collection
                    was donated to Corpus Christi College by either Richard Pernham (1583?-1628) or his wife Mary, whose
                    name is in many of these books.</p>
