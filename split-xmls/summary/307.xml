                <p>CCCC MS 307 consists of two manuscripts bound together, probably by Parker. The first is a copy of
                    the <title>Life of St Guthlac</title> by Felix of Crowland (fl.eighth century) written in English
                    Square minuscule, a script descended from earlier Insular minuscule. It has traditionally been dated
                    to the ninth century, but more recent palaeographical work makes a date in the early tenth much more
                    likely. It also has two acrostic poems on Guthlac, which have become corrupt in copying. The second
                    part of the manuscript is a fourteenth-century collection of works by John Waleys OFM (d. 1285), and
                    one text, the <title>De ente et essentia</title>, by Thomas Aquinas OP (1224/5-74).</p>
