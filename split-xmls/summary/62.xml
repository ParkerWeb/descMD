                <p>CCCC MS 62 comprises three volumes, the first dated to the late twelfth century, or the beginning of
                    the thirteenth, the latter two dated to the twelfth century. All three volumes have a provenance at
                    the cathedral priory of St Andrew at Rochester, Kent, and appear in a list of manuscripts copied or
                    acquired by the precentor, Alexander, in or soon after 1202. The first volume contains a glossed
                    copy of the Books of Proverbs, Ecclesiastes and the Song of Songs. The second volume consists of a
                    selection of writings by William of Saint-Thierry, Bernard of Clairvaux, Serlo of Wilton and John of
                    Cornwall. The final volume contains Bede's Commentary on the Catholic Epistles and a letter by
                    Walter Phillips, dean of Rochester (1560).</p>
