                <p>CCCC MS 322 contains the translation of Gregory the Great's <title>Dialogues</title> made by
                    Wærferth, Bishop of Worcester in the late ninth and early tenth centuries, at the request of King
                    Alfred the Great. It is the only surviving witness to large parts of the text. It was written in the
                    second half of the eleventh century probably at Worcester, where it has later provenance. James's
                    suggestion of provenance at Bury St Edmunds, provoked by the form of the manuscript's classmark and
                    the inclusion of a similar manuscript in a Bury booklist, has been rejected by Ker.</p>
