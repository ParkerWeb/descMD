                <p>The <title>De pauperie Saluatoris</title> of Richard FitzRalph (d. 1360), archbishop of Armagh,
                    contained in CCCC MS 382, is a text on the poverty of the mendicants in relation to the poverty
                    taught by Christ, and the problems caused by their acquiring property and privilege. It is also
                    found in <ref type="ms" target="CCC103">CCCC MSS 103</ref> and <ref type="ms" target="CCC180"
                        >180</ref>. The dating of this copy has been suggested as c. 1375-1400. It belonged to St
                    Augustine's, Canterbury, and is in the fifteenth-century library catalogue of the abbey.</p>
