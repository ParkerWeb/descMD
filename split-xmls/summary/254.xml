                <p>CCCC MS 254 contains a thirteenth-century copy of the text of Gregory IX's Decretals
                        (<title>Decretales nouae</title>). Judging from the number of scribbled annotations that appear
                    in several different hands in the margins of the text, it would appear that a succession of canon
                    lawyers regarded this volume as their working copy of an important text for church discipline and
                    government. There is no clue as to the manuscript's provenance, though presumably Parker acquired it
                    as part of his desire to understand the origins and nature of papal and episcopal authority in
                    England in his effort to entrench the English Reformation.</p>
