                <p>CCCC MS 424 is comprised of a number of disparate elements, with six volumes bound together
                    containing material from different centuries. The manuscript begins with three printed pamphlets, an
                    epitome of Galen by Christopher Heyll, an account of the marriage of Philip of Spain and Mary I of
                    England and of a speech given by the Cardinal of Lorraine in 1561. The manuscript material proper is
                    a jumble of medical, astrological and spiritual treatises such as the <title>Regimen sanitatis
                        Salernitanum</title>, Robert Grosseteste (d. 1253), <title>De impressionibus aeris siue De
                        prognosticatione</title> and Thomas de Frakaham OSA (fl. c. 1200) <title>Speculum spiritalis
                        amicitiae</title> copied in various hands between the thirteenth and the fifteenth centuries. In
                    addition the codex includes an earlier twelfth-century copy of the legend of Aseneth in a Latin
                    translation from the Greek.</p>
