            <div xml:id="CCC040" n="MS 40">
                <p>CCCC MS 40 is the earliest known text by Francesco Petrarca (Petrarch) (1304-74) to be copied in
                    England in the last quarter of the fourteenth century, his <title>De remediis utriusque
                        fortunae</title>. The text is concerned with the limitations of worldly success and pleasure,
                    and the problems of misfortune and adversity. A large part of this is in the form of a dialogue
                    between joy (<title>Gaudium</title>) and adversity (<title>Dolor</title>) with reason
                        (<title>Ratio</title>). It is given a Humanist emphasis by its supposed use of a classical model
                    - the <title>De remediis fortuitorum</title>, attributed in the Middle Ages to Seneca. There is no
                    evidence for the place of production or ownership of the manuscript.</p>
