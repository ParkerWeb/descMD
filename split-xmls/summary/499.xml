                <p>CCCC MS 499 is a late fourteenth-century or early-fifteenth century German manuscript containing the
                    Commentary on the Song of Songs by Honorius Augustodunensis (Honorius of Autun) (fl. 1106-35),
                        <title>Historia passionis Jesu Christi</title> by Michael of Massa (Michele Beccucci de Massa)
                    OESA (c.1298-1337), a list of the Gospel readings for the year, a partial copy of the New Testament
                    and a collection of homilies. The book has its original fifteenth-century binding with metal bosses
                    and straps. This volume is part of the Elbing collection; a group of manuscripts which belonged to a
                    Brigittine convent at Elbing (Elblag), near Gdansk. The collection was donated to Corpus Christi
                    College by either Richard Pernham (1583?-1628) or his wife Mary, whose name is in many of these
                    books.</p>
