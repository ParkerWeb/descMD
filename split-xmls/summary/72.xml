                <p>Although arranged according to the texts of the four Gospels, rather than arranging the specific
                    readings according to the Sundays and feast days of the year, CCCC MS 72, was intended to serve as a
                    Gospel Lectionary for the readings at Mass. It begins with a table of the Gospel readings for the
                    church year, and in the margins are the names of the days on which the appropriate passages of text
                    are to be read. The Gospel text has been compared with Bibles produced at Canterbury and Glunz
                    classifies it as 'Lanfranc's Scholastic Text'. Although M. R. James thought that it might have been
                    made at St Albans, it is now thought more likely that it was made at Christ Church cathedral priory,
                    Canterbury. It has three very large and fine illuminated ornamental initials, and many smaller ones.
                    A dating of the book to the closing years of the twelfth century, perhaps c. 1180, seems likely.</p>
