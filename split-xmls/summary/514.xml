                <p>CCCC 514, probably written in Germany, contains a collection of sermons for the temporal by the
                    Franciscan preacher and theologian Conrad Holtnicker of Saxony (d. 1279). The collection was a
                    popular model in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries and formed the basis for a well-known
                    vernacular collection, the Schwarzwälder Predigten. This volume is part of the Elbing collection, a
                    group of manuscripts associated with the Brigittine convent at Elbing (Elblag), near Gdansk which
                    was founded in 1458 and deserted in 1521. Almost all the Elbing manuscripts contain the ownership
                    inscription of Mary Pernham, wife of Richard Pernham (d. 1628), Fellow of the college and <hi
                        rend="italic">pastor Anglicus</hi> of St Marien church in Elbing from 1618-24.</p>
