                <p>CCCC MS 135 is a collection of the letters of Anselm of Canterbury OSB (d. 1109) with other related
                    works. It may be the collection made by Anselm of Bury OSB (d. 1148), the saint's nephew, since it
                    has certain provenance at Bury St Edmunds. It has been suggested that it was made for the younger
                    Anselm at Canterbury, but a Bury origin seems more likely since it shares a scribe with several
                    manuscripts from Bury, including Cambridge, Trinity College, MS R. 7. 28 (scribe 2). It seems to
                    have come into the hands of the historian John Bale (1495-1563) and thence to Parker.</p>
