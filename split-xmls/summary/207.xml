                <p> CCCC MS 207 contains two tracts and a collection of documents relating to heresies and was compiled
                    during the first half of the sixteenth century. The volume begins with a series of letters and
                    documents regarding the Nestorian Heresy and the council of Chalcedon (the Fourth Ecumenical
                    Council, 8 Oct.-1 Nov. 451, called due to the heresy of Eutyches). This is followed by two tracts
                    relating to the split between the Greek Orthodox church and Rome: <title>De haeresibus Grecorum de
                        processione spiritus sancti</title> by Hugo Etherianus (d. 1182) and <title>Contra Graecos de
                        processione spiritus sancti (Libri IV adversus errores Graecorum)</title> by Manuel Calecas (fl.
                    1360-, d. 1410), trans. by Ambrogio Traversari OSB (also known as Ambrosius Camaldulensis).</p>
