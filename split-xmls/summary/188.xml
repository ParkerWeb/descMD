                <p>CCCC MS 188 contains most of the first series of Ælfric's Catholic Homilies, with a few supplementary
                    pieces also by Ælfric OSB (d. c. 1010). It probably originally contained the whole of the first
                    series, but some material has been lost. It was written in the first half of the eleventh century.
                    Because of a note it contains (recording the copying of a new homily before it was sent to Bishop
                    Æthelwold), it has been argued that this manuscript is a faithful copy of one prepared under the
                    supervision of Ælfric himself at Eynsham where he was abbot, and represents an official revision of
                    his first series of Catholic Homilies. We know that Parker received some Old English manuscripts
                    from Hereford, and it has been suggested that MS 188 was one of these, but on no very firm
                    grounds.</p>
