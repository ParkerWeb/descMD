                <p>CCCC MS 289 is a twelfth-century compilation of texts on aspects of Christian doctrine. The
                    manuscript was written by two hands, both of which are very fine. The texts contained in the
                    manuscript include works by Augustine, Vigilius Thapsensis (fl. 484), Ivo of Chartres (c.
                    1040-1115), Bruno of Asti (d. 1125) and Walter of Mortagne (d. 1174). James suggested that the book
                    might be identified with a manuscript found in the early fourteenth-century catalogue of Christ
                    Church, Canterbury, compiled under Henry of Eastry (1284-1331), but this is by no means certain.</p>
