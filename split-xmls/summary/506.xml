                <p>CCCC MS 506 was written in Prague between 1393 and some time after 1399. It contains a large
                    collection of sermons by Guibert of Tournai OFM (d. 1284), extracts from the <title>Postilla
                        litteralis in uetus et nouum testamentum</title> by Nicholas of Lyre OFM (d. 1349), a
                        <title>Disputatio de censibus perpetuis</title> by Michael Blide, <hi rend="italic">doctor
                        decretorum</hi> of the University of Prague in 1399, and finally a canon law tract. The dating
                    is based on a colophon at the end of the sermons and on the text by Michael Blide. The book has a
                    contemporary binding. This volume is part of the Elbing collection; a group of manuscripts which
                    belonged to a Brigittine convent at Elbing (Elblag), near Gdansk. The collection was donated to
                    Corpus Christi College by Richard Pernham (1583?-1628) or his wife, Mary, whose signature is in many
                    of these books.</p>
