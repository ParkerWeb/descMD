                <p>CCCC MS 87 is an early thirteenth-century copy of the commentary on Leviticus by Ralph of Flaix OSB
                    (d. 1157), in a very fine hand. M. R. James suggested that the provenance of the manuscript might be
                    Worcester, although this was rejected by Ker. James also identified this manuscript as being the
                    copy of Ralph of Flaix's commentary mentioned in an early fourteenth-century catalogue from Christ
                    Church, Canterbury, although this identification is doubtful. The unusual binding of this
                    manuscript, being of velvet with clasps and bosses, is characteristic of the 'Old Royal' library of
                    Henry VIII. As a result of the fragility of this binding it has only been possible to image the
                    exterior and interior of the covers and ff. 1-17r and f. 136r.</p>
