                <p>CCCC MS 427 is a collection of chronicles in a series of fifteenth-century hands. Its contents
                    include the <title>Chronica pontificum et imperatorum</title> of Martin of Troppau OP (d. 1278),
                        <title>Compilatio de gestis Britonum et Anglorum</title> of Peter of Ickham OSB (d. 1295) with a
                    continuation to 1427, an abridgement of the <title>Historia destructionis Troiae</title>, written in
                    1287 by Guido de Columnis (not to be confused with his namesake Guido delle Colonne - d. c. 1280),
                    an abstract of Bede's <title>Historia ecclesiastica</title> and another chronicle which may be based
                    on the <title>Speculum historiale</title> of Richard of Cirencester OSB (d. 1401). This material
                    typifies Parker's interest in manuscripts of English and wider history which he employed to ensure
                    the sound historical foundations of his ideas for the future of the reformed church in England.</p>
