            <div xml:id="CCC383" n="MS 383">
                <p>CCCC MS 383 is a late eleventh- or early twelfth-century manuscript, possibly from St Paul's
                    Cathedral in London. It contains a very early version of the Anglo-Saxon law codes as they were
                    gathered together to form part of the textual tradition known as the <title>Quadripartitus</title>.
                    Parker was no doubt fascinated by the presence of Anglo-Saxon material in this volume, which
                    contains a number of texts unique to it, such as the <title>Gerefa</title>. The manuscript was, at
                    some stage, in the hands of Robert Talbot, prebendary of Norwich (d. 1558) and contains notes in his
                    hand as well as that of Parker's secretary, John Joscelyn (1529-1603). It has been much studied
                    throughout its history; the sixteenth-century antiquarians' notes accompany glosses dating from the
                    thirteenth century .</p>
