                <p>CCCC MS 415 contains the unique text of an author once universally known as 'The York Anonymous' but
                    now thought to have been written by a Norman ecclesiastic, probably from Rouen, and hence its modern
                    appellation as 'The Norman (or 'Rouen') Anonymous'. The manuscript, which was copied in the late
                    eleventh or early twelfth century, consists of a number of tracts which have as their broad theme
                    the relationship between the spiritual and temporal power. It has special significance because it
                    was written shortly after the Investiture Controversy; this controversy was over the power of lay
                    princes to invest and receive homage from abbots and bishops, which was forbidden by Pope Gregory
                    VII in 1075. Although frequently discussed in the literature of the history of the relationship
                    between the medieval church and state, the unique private nature of the text makes it highly
                    unlikely that the complex ideas expressed in it ever gained a wide readership.</p>
