            <div xml:id="CCC263" n="MS 263">
                <p>CCCC MS 263 is a thirteenth-century incomplete copy of the <title>Speculum ecclesiae</title> by the
                    theologian Honorius Augustodunensis (fl. 1106-1135 and probably d. 1151). This work is a collection
                    of sermons. Neil Ker described as dubious the provenance attributed to the manuscript, namely the
                    Benedictine cathedral priory of the Holy Trinity, Christ Church, Canterbury. CCCC MS 263 has
                    received far less scholarly attention than other manuscripts of Honorius' works in the Parker
                    collection, such as the <title>Imago mundi</title> in <ref type="ms" target="CCC066">CCCC MS
                        66</ref>. Matthew Parker wrote "Canterbury" in this manuscript, suggesting that he acquired it
                    there. Christ Church, Canterbury had some copies of this text in the Middle Ages, but MS 263 does
                    not seem to appear in any of the surviving catalogues.</p>
