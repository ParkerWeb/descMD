                <p>This manuscript, dating from the thirteenth century, contains biblical commentaries by Stephen
                    Langton (c. 1150-1228) on parts of the Old Testament. Included are commentaries on the Pentateuch,
                    and the books from Joshua through to Maccabees. It has been noted that CCCC MS 55 contains
                    substantial textual differences to other copies of the same works. The marginal notes in this
                    manuscript are of particular interest in determining the relationship between Langton's commentaries
                    and his sermons, as they seems to show the excerpting of material from the commentaries for use in
                    preaching texts. CCCC MS 55 has been identified as the manuscript mentioned in a letter to Matthew
                    Parker from Aylmer, Archdeacon of Lincoln, thus suggesting that the manuscript was in Lincoln by the
                    mid-sixteenth century.</p>
