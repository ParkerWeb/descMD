                <p>CCCC MS 221 consists of two volumes bound together to make a collection of works on orthography by
                    Alcuin, Bede, Cassiodorus, Flavius Caper, and Agroecius. The first part, containing the works by
                    Alcuin and Bede, was probably written at a Breton centre on the Continent in the first half of the
                    tenth century. It has a few marginal notes in Tironian shorthand. The second part, which is probably
                    tenth-century, may be either Continental or English. Because Bishop thought that the first part
                    shares a scribe with Cambridge, Gonville and Caius, MS 144/194, a manuscript with certain medieval
                    provenance at St Augustine's, Canterbury, this manuscript has been associated with St Augustine's as
                    well. However, its complete lack of St Augustine's provenance marks does make that less likely. It
                    was one of the manuscripts which came to Corpus from the collection of Daniel Rogers, who acquired
                    books both in England and on his extensive travels abroad.</p>
