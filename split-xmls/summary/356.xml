                <p>The miscellany of texts in CCCC MS 356 are in three separate parts of various dates probably bound
                    together in the sixteenth century or later. The first, dating from the second half of the thirteenth
                    century, is the <title>Summa Qui bene praesunt</title> by Richard of Wetheringsett (fl. c. 1200-30),
                    first recorded chancellor of Cambridge University at some time between 1215 and 1232. This text is
                    also contained in <ref type="ms" target="CCC337">CCCC MS 337</ref>. The second part, also of the
                    thirteenth century, contains several texts including Hugh of Saint-Victor OSA (d. 1141), <title>De
                        institutione nouiciorum</title>, the <title>De sex alis cherubim</title> by Alain of Lille (d.
                    1202), but also attributed to Clement of Llanthony OSA (d. after 1169), and treatises on baptism and
                    the mass. The third part is of the late tenth century and contains a Glossary of Latin words. In the
                    margin of f. 20r in this section is a <title>Sanctus</title> with neumes.</p>
