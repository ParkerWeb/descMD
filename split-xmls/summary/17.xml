                <p>CCCC MS 17 is a twelfth-century volume of texts by Augustine of Hippo, and one sermon which is
                    attributed to John Chrysostom in this manuscript, but which was sometimes claimed for Augustine in
                    the Middle Ages. This sermon was included in Alain of Farfa's eighth-century Homiliary (Winter, item
                    92), and therefore circulated widely in the Middle Ages. MS 17 is not used for published editions of
                    any of the texts it contains. M. R. James suggested it might be from Norwich cathedral priory,
                    presumably because of the classmark it contains, but Neil Ker found no reason to sustain this
                    attribution.</p>
