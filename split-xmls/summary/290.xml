                <p>CCCC MS 290 was almost certainly produced at the Benedictine abbey of St Albans, Hertfordshire, in
                    the late eleventh or early twelfth century. It contains a number of texts concerned with continental
                    history, of which the main texts are the <title>Chronicon</title> (<title>De sex aetatibus
                        mundi</title>) of Ado of Vienne (d. 875), followed by genealogies of the Frankish kings and the
                    dukes of Normandy. In the early fourteenth century the <title>Registrum Anglie</title> recorded that
                    the manuscript was still at St Albans. The flyleaves preserve deeds bearing the date 1521 and a
                    notarial mark which mentions John Dowman (or Dolman) LLD (d.1524), elected Vice-Chancellor of
                    Cambridge University in 1495.</p>
