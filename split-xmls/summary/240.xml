                <p>CCCC MS 240 is the unique fifteenth-century copy of the Latin chronicle known as the <title>Ypodigma
                        Neustriae</title> often, and probably mistakenly, attributed to Thomas Walsingham (c. 1370-c.
                    1422). The <title>Ypodigma Neustriae</title> is a chronicle of events in Normandy and England from
                    911 to 1416 and written, perhaps, as a flattery to Henry V's successful conquests in France. Its
                    dating can probably be narrowed down to c. 1419. Nothing is known of how this manuscript came to be
                    in Parker's collection, though it was, presumably, one of the many manuscripts dealing with
                    historical themes that the archbishop acquired from the monastery of St Alban, Hertfordshire which
                    had produced some of the greatest medieval English monastic chroniclers. See also <ref type="ms"
                        target="MS 176">MS 176</ref>. The book is bound in an old limp vellum binding. As a result of
                    the fragility of this binding it has only been possible to image the exterior and interior of the
                    covers and part of the text pages, ff. ir-iiiv, 1r-24v.</p>
