                <p>CCCC MS 214 is an eleventh-century English copy of Boethius (c. 480-c. 524), <title>De consolatione
                        philosophiae</title>, a popular work in Anglo-Saxon England. It was written by the same scribe
                    as <ref type="ms" target="CCC411">CCCC MS 411</ref>. It has a large number of glosses, some in Old
                    English, and the layout of the manuscript suggests that it was always intended to receive this extra
                    material, much of which is from the glosses on Boethius by Remigius of Auxerre (c. 841-c. 908). At
                    some point the manuscript was damaged to an unusual degree by rats, necessitating the mounting of
                    the parchment in frames of paper. The manuscript was not owned by Matthew Parker; it comes from the
                    collection of Daniel Rogers, d. 1591.</p>
