                <p>CCCC MS 301 contains a number of texts relating to St Augustine's, Canterbury, copied in the early
                    fourteenth century. Among the texts included in the volume are two chronicles; one describing events
                    from the arrival of Brutus in England to the accession of Henry III derived firstly from Bede, and
                    from English twelfth-century writers such as Geoffrey of Monmouth (d. 1154), William of Malmesbury
                    OSB (c. 1080-1143), Henry of Huntingdon (1084-1155) and Roger of Howden (d. c. 1201). The other
                    chronicle is based on a foreign source and covers the period from the Incarnation to 1316. In
                    addition, this manuscript contains an early fourteenth-century Anglo-Norman copy of the
                        <title>Hosebandrie</title> of Walter of Henley (d. c. 1290/1300), a treatise on estate
                    management and accounting, and a number of veterinary recipes, also in Anglo-Norman. The book was
                    donated to St Augustine's by Stephen de Hackyngton (fl. 1332). Matthew Parker no doubt valued it for
                    the light it shed on the history of Canterbury, a recurring theme in his collection.</p>
