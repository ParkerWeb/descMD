                <p>CCCC MS 231 contains six of the comedies of Terence (195-159 B.C.). It was written in the first half
                    of the twelfth century in Germany. It seems to have been used by Richard Bentley for his edition of
                    Terence's works and has been often referred to by subsequent scholars working on the text of the
                    comedies. The manuscript was not owned by Matthew Parker, but probably came to the college from the
                    book collection of Daniel Rogers (c. 1539-91), who presumably acquired it on his travels abroad.</p>
