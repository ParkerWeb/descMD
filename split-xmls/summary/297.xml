            <div xml:id="CCC297" n="MS 297">
                <p>CCCC MS 297 is an interesting manuscript because of its very ordinariness. It contains a number of
                    disparate texts copied at Thorney Abbey in Cambridgeshire between the early thirteenth and
                    fourteenth centuries, including copies of legal material such as the <title>Statuta
                        abbreviata</title> and an account of a dispute involving the abbot of Thorney, together with
                    tracts on diplomatic practice, husbandry, medicine (both human and veterinary) and accounting. The
                    suggestion must be that this volume was one of very many created as a commonplace book either for a
                    monastic administrator or as a more general source of information useful to a monastic
                    community.</p>
