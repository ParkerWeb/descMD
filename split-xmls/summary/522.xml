                <p>The binding of CCCC MS 522, although contemporary, is in a very damaged state with little remaining
                    of the boards. The book was made in Germany in the mid-fifteenth century, and contains one work, the
                        <title>Sententiae</title> by Peter Lombard (c. 1095-1160). The text is decorated with many fine
                    penflourish initials. This volume is part of the Elbing collection, a group of manuscripts
                    associated with the Brigittine convent at Elbing (Elblag), near Gdansk which was founded in 1458 and
                    deserted in 1521. Almost all the Elbing manuscripts contain the ownership inscription of Mary
                    Pernham, wife of Richard Pernham (1583?-1628), Fellow of the college and <hi rend="italic">pastor
                        Anglicus</hi> of St Marien church in Elbing from 1618-24. They were evidently given to the
                    college either by Richard or by Mary.</p>
