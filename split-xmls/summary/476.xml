                <p>CCCC MS 476 contains a mixture of chronicle and legal material with an emphasis on London. Among the
                    more general material is the <title>Prophetia Ambrosii Merlini</title> (book 7 of Geoffrey of
                    Monmouth (d. 1154), <title>Historia regum Britanniae</title>), and a chronicle from the death of
                    Edward the Confessor to the crowning of Edward I (1274). The London material is a collection of
                    copies of charters temp. William I to Henry III, a brief account of how judicial eyres ought to be
                    carried out in London and notes on proceedings at the London eyre of 1226. Most interesting is what
                    appears to be a transcript that also appears in the London Guildhall <title>Liber Custumarum</title>
                    of an attempt by the citizens of London to be absolved of a debt of £200 to the Crown. This must
                    date the copying of this portion of the codex to after October 1313 (the date of the royal writ
                    ordering an inquiry into the matter), and possibly before July 1314 when the writ absolving the
                    sheriffs of the debt was issued but which does not appear in this manuscript.</p>
