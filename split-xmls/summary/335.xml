                <p>The greater part of the material in CCCC MS 335 is concerned with Christian attitudes to Islam. It
                    contains fourteenth- and early fifteenth-century copies of texts that were the result of Peter the
                    Venerable's (c. 1092-1156) travels in Muslim Spain and which were frequently transmitted together.
                    These include Peter's own <title>Letter</title> to Bernard of Clairvaux OCist (1090-1153), Robert of
                    Ketton (d. after 1157) <title>Chronica mendosa Sarracenorum</title>, <title>De generatione
                        Mahumet</title> and <title>De doctrina Mahumet</title> sometimes attributed to Hermann of
                    Carinthia (Hermann Dalmatin, c. 1100-c. 1160), Riccoldus de Monte Crucis OP (1242-1320)
                        <title>Libellus contra legem Sarracenorum</title> and the Letter of a Saracen and Christian
                    Response, the translation by Peter of Toledo (fl. c. 1142-3) and Peter of Poitiers (c. 1130-1205) of
                    the <title>Apologia</title> (<title>Risala</title>) attributed to al-Kindi. In addition the
                    manuscript contains a number of minor texts, including an <title>Orthographia Gallica</title>,
                    medical recipes and prognostications. The manuscript was once at the cathedral priory of Ely,
                    according to an inscription at the end of the book.</p>
