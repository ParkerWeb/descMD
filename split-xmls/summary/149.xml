            <div xml:id="CCC149" n="MS 149">
                <p>CCCC MS 149 is a manuscript of the <title>Historia Iosephi de bello iudaico et excidio urbis
                        Hierosolymitanae</title>, pseudonymously attributed to the second-century historian, Hegesippus,
                    as was common in the Middle Ages. On the grounds of its script it can be dated to the first half of
                    the twelfth century. A partially erased <hi rend="italic">ex libris</hi> inscription shows that it
                    was at a foundation dedicated to St Andrew, and the Augustinian priory of Hexham has been suggested.
                    The manuscript has flyleaves from a mid-twelfth-century Italian legal manuscript. According to
                    James, fragments from the same manuscript survive in Cambridge, Gonville and Caius College MS 285,
                    and in Cambridge, Pembroke College MS 7, a manuscript which Robert Grosseteste (d. 1253) gave to
                    Bury St Edmunds in exchange for another.</p>
