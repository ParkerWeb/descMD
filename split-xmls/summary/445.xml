                <p>CCCC MS 445 contains a fourteenth-century copy of the <title>Summa dictaminis secundum stilum romanae
                        curiae</title> by Richard de Pophis (Pofi) (fl. c. 1256-71), a handbook for the writing of
                    ecclesiastical letters and documents with special reference to the form of words to be employed at
                    the conclusion of each sentence. Known as the <title>Cursus</title>, this may have originated as a
                    way to try to prevent crude forgery of papal documents, but by the time that this copy of Richard's
                    work was copied, it had become a rigid system of stylistic conventions which necessitated handbooks
                    to ensure its proper employment.</p>
