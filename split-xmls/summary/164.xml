                <p>CCCC MS 164 contains several distinct elements, an incomplete copy of Ranulf Higden OSB (d. 1364)
                        <title>Polychronicon</title>, dating to the late fourteenth century, a number of works of Hugh
                    of Fouilloy OSA (d. c. 1172/3) (including <title>De columba</title>, <title>De rota
                        praelationis</title> and <title>Auicularius</title>) and a number of sermons all in various
                    thirteenth-century hands, and an early fifteenth-century <title>Biblia pauperum</title>, the
                    illustrated version of the Life of Christ parallelled by their Old Testament types. This
                        <title>Biblia pauperum</title> is illustrated by drawings and was probably made in the
                    Netherlands. It is an unusual version very iconographically close to a fully painted version,
                    London, BL MS King's 5, made in the North Netherlands c. 1400-1410. The later provenance of this
                    manuscript is partially attested by a record of the purchase of the book in 1492 by John Gunthorpe
                    (d. 1498), dean of Wells cathedral and Richard III's Keeper of the Privy Seal, from 'David Lyenel'
                    for 4s 4d. Gunthorpe donated some of his manuscripts to Jesus College, Cambridge, in 1496 and much
                    of the rest of his library was left to Wells cathedral, but exactly how this manuscript came into
                    Parker's collection is unknown.</p>
