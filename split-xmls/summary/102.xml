            <div xml:id="CCC102" n="MS 102">
                <p>Matthew Parker's manuscript collection naturally reflects his interest in Reformation theology and
                    theologians and the religious debates which took place in the sixteenth century. MS 102 is one of
                    the compilations of tracts and letters Parker assembled from his collection. The volume opens with
                    several pieces relating to the public disputation held in Cambridge between the Regius Professor of
                    Divinity, Martin Bucer (1491-1551), and masters Young, Sedgewick and Perne. This material is
                    followed by a treatise by Christopher Carlile (d. c. 1588), an English clergyman and graduate of
                    Corpus Christi College, Cambridge. Much of the rest of the volume relates to debates regarding the
                    sacraments and to tracts and materials relating to rebellion and sedition. The manuscript dates to
                    third quarter of the sixteenth century.</p>
