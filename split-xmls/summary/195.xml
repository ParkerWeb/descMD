                <p>CCCC MS 195 contains a copy of Thomas Walsingham OSB (d. c. 1422), <title>Chronica maiora</title>.
                    The majority of the text was copied in the second quarter of the fifteenth century, but lacunae have
                    been filled in a sixteenth-century hand with a version of the text perhaps taken from London,
                    College of Arms MS Arundel VII. This manuscript, which was once in the hands of the historian John
                    Bale (1495-1563) before passing to Parker, was used by Parker as the basis for his edition of the
                        <title>Historia breuis</title> published in 1574.</p>
