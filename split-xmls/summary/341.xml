                <p>CCCC MS 341 is primarily a sixteenth-century paper transcript of Eadmer of Canterbury OSB (c. 1060-
                    d. after 1124), <title>Historia nouorum in Anglia</title>, most likely copied from <ref type="ms"
                        target="CCC452">CCCC MS 452</ref> while it was in the possession of Dr Henry Johns. This
                    chronicle of English history covers the period c. 1066-c. 1122. However, loose within the book are
                    two inserted fragments: one, a leaf from Eadmer, <title>Historia nouorum</title>, and the other from
                    Eadmer, <title>Vita Anselmi</title>. Both leaves date from the first half of the twelfth century,
                    and are believed to be autograph copies of Eadmer's works. Their provenance has thus been identified
                    as the Benedictine cathedral priory of the Holy Trinity, Christ Church, Canterbury.</p>
