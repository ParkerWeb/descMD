                <p>CCCC MS 224 contains the Gospel of St Mark in Greek, copied by George Hermonymus, perhaps in the
                    1470s when he was working in Paris. As Kalatzi has shown, it was originally part of a set of all
                    four Gospels, which was separated in the sixteenth century. The other three parts are Oxford,
                    Bodleian MS Canon.gr. 33 (Matthew), Paris, Bibliothèque nationale MS gr. 99 (Luke), and Paris,
                    Bibliothèque de l'Institut MS 536 (John). CCCC MS 224 has the same sixteenth-century French binding,
                    by Julien des Jardins, as the Bodleian manuscript. As a result of the fragility of this binding it
                    has only been possible to image the exterior and interior of the covers and part of the text pages,
