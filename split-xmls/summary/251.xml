            <div xml:id="CCC251" n="MS 251">
                <p>CCCC MS 251 contains two chronicles: a brief abstracted roll-call of the popes from Gregory IX to
                    1370, followed by an account of English history from Brutus to the accession of Richard II with an
                    emphasis on events pertinent to the abbey at Bury St Edmunds. Both texts were written c. 1445. Even
                    though the press mark ('E.43') appears to be in error, since manuscripts at Bury St Edmunds were
                    classified by subject matter - the volume, M. R. James argued, should fall under 'C' for
                        <title>Chronica</title> - James had no doubt the manuscript was from Bury on the grounds of the
                    content which, as part of the chronicle material, includes a life of St Edmund. Also recorded in
                    this volume is a note on the round chapel at Bury St Edmunds which also appears in London, College
                    of Arms MS Arundel XXX, which was certainly written for the monks at Bury. The manuscript is
                    decorated with two historiated initials and many illuminated ornamental initials.</p>
