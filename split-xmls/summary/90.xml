                <p>CCCC MS 90 contains books one to four of the <title>Doctrinale antiquitatum fidei</title> by Thomas
                    Netter of Walden OCarm (c. 1370–1430) and dates to around 1427. It has been suggested that this
                    manuscript may have been one of the books Netter gave to the London Carmelites. The work forms part
                    of Thomas Netter's refutation of Lollard teachings. Netter was, himself, a Carmelite friar who
                    served as the prior provincial of the Carmelite order in England, as confessor to both Henry V and
                    Henry VI of England, and as Henry V's envoy to King W?adis?aw of Poland and Michael Küchmeister,
                    grand master of the Teutonic knights.</p>
