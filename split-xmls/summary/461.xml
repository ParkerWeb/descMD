                <p>The four texts by several scribes in CCCC MS 461, dating to the early thirteenth century, have no
                    apparent thematic connection. Perhaps they were originally separate volumes or pamphlets. The main
                    work in the book is the <title>Sententiarum abbreuiationes</title> of Peter Lombard (c. 1095-1160).
                    The others, all relatively short are <title>Exactis regibus</title> (or <title>Epitome iuris
                        ciuilis</title>), a civil law text, Richard the Premonstratensian (fl. late twelfth century),
                        <title>De canone missae</title>, sometimes attributed to John of Cornwall (d. after 1179), and
                    the <title>Speculum ecclesiae</title> by the pseudo-Hugh of Saint-Victor OSA. The book also contains
                    four diagrams on ff. 34r-35v which pertain to the commentary by Bernardus Silvestris (d. c. 1178) on
                    Martianus Capella, <title>De nuptiis Philologiae et Mercurii</title>.</p>
