                <p>CCCC MS 189 is made up of two volumes. The first section is a collection of documents relating to
                    Canterbury including a chronology, copies of Anglo-Saxon charters and papal letters copied in the
                    later fourteenth century but with material added to in later years down to the reign of Henry VI.
                    The second volume is one of two surviving copies of William Thorne's (fl. c. 1397)
                        <title>Chronicle</title> (to 1375) (the other copy, to 1397, being in British Library, Add. MS
                    53710). The provenance of this manuscript is well attested. It was almost certainly acquired after
                    the Dissolution from St Augustine's, Canterbury by the antiquarian John Twyne (c. 1501-81).
                    Thereafter, a note in the manuscript records how it was in the possession of Thomas Twyne
                    (1543-1613), John Twyne's son, and was given to Parker by Robert Breacher, a former monk of St
                    Augustine's and royal chaplain to Elizabeth I.</p>
