                <p>MS 114, now split into two parts (<ref type="ms" target="CCC114A">MS 114A</ref> and MS 114B),
                    contains a large collection of letters written to or by Matthew Parker (1504-75). His diverse career
                    included serving as the dean of the Suffolk college of Stoke by Clare; as one of Anne Boleyn's
                    chaplains and, after her fall, as one of the king's chaplains; as master of Corpus Christi College
                    and Vice-Chancellor of the University of Cambridge; and, after a forced period of seclusion during
                    the reign of Mary, as archbishop of Canterbury. Just as this broad career is reflected across the
                    Parker Library collection as a whole, much of it is reflected here in a microcosm of letters. The
                    manuscript dates to the sixteenth century.</p>
