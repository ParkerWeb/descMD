                <p>The moral and devotional tracts in CCCC MS 524 are concerned with the virtues and vices, a biblical
                    summary, the Passion of Christ, and the sacrament of the Mass. These include the <title>Summarium
                        biblicum</title> attributed to Alexander of Villa Dei (c. 1170-1240), and the <title>Passio
                        Domini</title> by Henrik Totting van Oyta (c. 1330-97). The book, made in Germany or Bohemia,
                    dating from c. 1400, belonged to the Brigittine convent of nuns at Elbing (Elblag), near Gdansk. It
                    came to the College in the seventeenth century, donated by Richard Pernham (1583?-1628), Fellow and
                    Vicar of Stowmarket (Suffolk), or by his wife Mary, whose signature is in many of the books. The
                    Pernhams had acquired the manuscripts while Richard was acting as a minister in Germany. The first
                    text, a work on the virtues and vices, <title>Distinctiones</title>, has a colophon dating its
                    writing to the scribe John in 1404. The book has its original fifteenth-century binding with metal
                    tags and the remnants of a chain mark showing that it was once kept in a chained library.</p>
