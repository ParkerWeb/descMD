            <div xml:id="CCC076" n="MS 76">
                <p>CCCC MS 76 contains an incomplete copy of <title>De institutis coenobiorum</title> of John Cassian
                    (c. 360-435) and extracts from the <title>Abbreuiationes chronicorum</title> of Ralph de Diceto (d.
                    c. 1199/1200) under the title <title>Annales de Dorobernensibus Archiepiscopis</title>. The
                        <title>Annales</title> were copied in a late twelfth-century hand which, it has been argued, may
                    be that of Diceto himself. An inscription hints that this manuscript may have been intended for
                    presentation to Hubert Walter, archbishop of Canterbury (d. 1205). If so, this may explain how it
                    came to be in the possession of a later archbishop, Stephen Langton (c. 1165-1228) from whom it
                    passed to the priory of the Holy Trinity, Christ Church, Canterbury where it is recorded in the
                    early fourteenth-century library catalogue of Henry of Eastry.</p>
