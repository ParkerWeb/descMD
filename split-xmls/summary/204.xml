                <p>CCCC MS 204 contains Stephen Langton's <title>Commentaries</title> on the Old Testament books of
                    Isaiah, Kings, Chronicles and Maccabees, though the text on Kings is incomplete, containing only the
                    moral commentary rather than the full text. Stephen Langton (c. 1150-1228) wrote numerous
                    commentaries on the books of the Old and New Testaments, and is among the most important of early
                    scholastic commentators. The manuscript was written in the thirteenth century and contains a later,
                    perhaps fourteenth-century, incomplete title list and possible shelf mark.</p>
