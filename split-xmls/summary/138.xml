                <p>CCCC MS 138 is a portmanteau manuscript, dating to the last quarter of the fourteenth century. It
                    contains a wide variety of broadly historical material including extracts from Bede, the chronicles
                    of Matthew Paris OSB (c. 1200-59) and William of Jumièges OSB (d. 1087?), papal letters, a genealogy
                    of the kings of France and a list of the archbishops of York. Perhaps originally from Norwich
                    Cathedral Priory, MS 138 may have been one of several manuscripts now in the Parker collection that
                    was once in the possession of William Carye of Cheapside (d. 1573) and it certainly passed through
                    the hands of Robert Recorde (d. 1588), the mathematician and fellow of All Souls, Oxford, who copied
                    extracts from the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle into the margins of the early part of this manuscript.</p>
