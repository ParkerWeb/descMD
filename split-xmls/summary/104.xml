            <div xml:id="CCC104" n="MS 104">
                <p>Matthew Parker's manuscript collection naturally reflects his interest in Reformation theology and
                    theologians and the religious debates which took place in the sixteenth century. MS 104 is one of
                    the compilations of tracts Parker assembled from his collection. Among the tracts included in this
                    volume are gospel commentaries, an English translation of St Matthew's gospel and several sermons on
                    various topics including fortitude in suffering and the qualities of a king. The manuscript dates to
                    the third quarter of the sixteenth century. </p>
