                <p>CCCC MS 45 contains two distinct volumes. The first volume was very probably copied in France in the
                    mid-fourteenth century and features a number of pastoral and historical works by the Dominican
                    inquisitor and scholar Bernard Gui OP (1261/2-1331) together with a handsomely illustrated
                    genealogical table of the Frankish kings. The second volume is a copy of the prose version of the
                        <title>Roman de Lancelot</title> that has been dated to c. 1250 and may have been produced in
                    England. How this manuscript came into Parker's possession is unknown, but it seems likely that he
                    was more interested in the illustrated historical material than in the Arthurian Lancelot story.</p>
