                <p>CCCC MS 43 contains a copy of William of Malmesbury OSB (c. 1080-1143), <title>Gesta pontificum
                        Anglorum</title>, together with a complete version of Adam of Eynsham OSB (d. after 1233)
                        <title>Visio Eadmundi monachi de Egnesham</title>. The greater part of the text is in a late
                    fourteenth-century hand, but the fifth book of the <title>Gesta pontificum</title>, together with
                    extracts from William of Malmesbury's <title>Gesta regum</title>, have been added in
                    sixteenth-century hands. Parker and his secretaries have added a number of aides mémoires to the
                    margins of the text, revealing their interest in the history of the English episcopacy. Some
                    fourteenth-century notes at the end of the manuscript, together with the script and ornament, led M.
                    R. James to believe that the manuscript had an East Anglian provenance, possibly from Norwich, but
                    its exact provenance remains unknown.</p>
