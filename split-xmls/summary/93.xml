                <p>The Ordinal of Exeter Cathedral is preserved in two manuscripts of the fifteenth century, Exeter,
                    Cathedral Library MS 3502 and CCCC MS 93. This copy is of c. 1400-25, but some of the border
                    decoration has been added in the second half of the fifteenth century. The Ordinal contains the
                    directions for the church services for the Mass and the Divine Office. The liturgical use of Exeter
                    was an adaptation for that diocese of the Use of Sarum which from the mid-thirteenth century onwards
                    spread over most parts of England. The book also contains a Martyrology of Exeter which compares
                    with that of Exeter, Cathedral Library MS 3518. These copies of the Ordinal reveal the extent of
                    difference from Sarum. MS 93 has fine illuminated borders with the monogram WS at the main divisions
                    of the text.</p>
