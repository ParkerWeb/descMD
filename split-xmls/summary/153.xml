                <p>This is a late ninth-century copy of Martianus Capella (fourth/fifth century), <title>De nuptiis
                        Philologiae et Mercurii</title>, with glossary and tenth-century additions. The manuscript is
                    Welsh, and includes many Old Welsh glosses, which were published by Whitley Stokes. The text is in a
                    variety of hands, including an attractive Caroline minuscule - an early example of the use of this
                    style in the British Isles - and thus attests to contacts between Francia and Wales in the ninth and
                    tenth centuries. The manuscript seems to have been in England early in its history and was
                    supplemented there.</p>
