                <p>CCCC MS 581 is a single large-sized leaf containing a contemporary account of Matthew Parker's
                    consecration as Archbishop of Canterbury on 17 December 1559 in the chapel of Lambeth Palace,
                    together with the document commissioning Walter Haddon as judge in the Prerogative Court of
                    Canterbury ten days later. Those present at the consecration are listed and the manner of the
                    service described. Presumably it was once part of Parker's personal collection of manuscript
                    material. It was returned to the Parker Library from the modern archives of the college in 1959.</p>
