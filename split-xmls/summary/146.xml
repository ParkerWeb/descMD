                <p> This manuscript is known as the Samson Pontifical because it contains an added formula for
                    professing obedience in the presence of Samson, bishop of Worcester 1096-1112. The main part of the
                    manuscript, a Pontifical and Benedictional, was made at the Old Minster, Winchester, in the early
                    eleventh century. It contains a version of the second English coronation ordo. The manuscript had
                    moved to Worcester by the second half of the eleventh century, where it received many additions and
                    alterations. Scribes reponsible for these also worked on CCCC MSS <ref type="ms" target="CCC391"
                        >391</ref> and <ref type="ms" target="CCC009">9</ref>. Hemming of Worcester, sub-prior in the
                    time of Archbishop Wulfstan (1062-1095), also added text to CCCC MS 146.</p>
