                <p>CCCC MS 131 is a fourteenth-century copy of Cassiodorus (d. c. 580), <title>Expositio
                        psalmorum</title> on the first fifty psalms. His works on each of the three books of fifty
                    psalms, widely read throughout the Middle Ages, seem to have travelled as separate volumes. This
                    manuscript has not been used in any edition of this work, although M. Adriaen, the editor of the
                    Corpus Christianorum Series Latina volumes, consulted it, discarding it as textually
                    insignificant.</p>
