            <div xml:id="CCC364" n="MS 364">
                <p>CCCC MS 364 contains a collection of medical tracts by Greek, Roman and Byzantine authors copied in
                    the early thirteenth century, including Latin translations of the <title>Tegni</title> of Galen, the
                        <title>Aphorismata</title> and <title>Prognostica</title> of Hippocrates, as well as the
                        <title>Liber urinarum</title> of Theophilus and part of the <title>Liber pulsuum</title> of
                    Philaretus. The manuscript was donated to St Augustine's, Canterbury by the monk William de Elham
                    (fl. c. 1300), who gave a number of other volumes to the abbey. It was still at St Augustine's in
                    the fifteenth century, where it appears in a library catalogue and, presumably, passed from that
                    institution more or less directly into Parker's collection.</p>
