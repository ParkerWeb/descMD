            <div xml:id="CCC582" n="MS 582">
                <p>CCCC MS 582 was formerly known as the Black Book. It was compiled by Archbishop Matthew Parker,
                    probably in 1574, and contains a number of important Corpus Christi documents, including the 1548-9
                    statutes, confirmed and signed by the ecclesiastical commissioners in January 1573/4. It also has
                    texts about Parker's donations to the University Library and Corpus Christi, including his gifts of
                    furniture for the use of the Norwich scholars. The manuscript has pictures of Elizabeth I and Parker
                    glued to its front and back boards. It still has the seal of the Court of High Commission, although
                    this is broken, and is still in its original Lambeth binding.</p>
