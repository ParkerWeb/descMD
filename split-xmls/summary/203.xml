                <p>MS 203 contains <title>Postilla litteralis in nouum testamentum</title> by Nicholas of Lyre OFM
                    (1270-1340). His biblical commentaries, which also included the Old Testament, were very popular in
                    the later centuries of the Middle Ages and the early modern period. A large number of manuscript and
                    early printed copies survive. The manuscript dates to the first quarter of the fifteenth century and
                    was donated by Thomas Fawscet.</p>
