                <p>CCCC MS 77 contains a copy of the <title>Speculum iudiciale</title> of Willelmus Durandus the Elder
                    (c. 1237-1296). Completed in 1271 and revised twice before the author's death, the
                        <title>Speculum</title> is a manual for the proper administration and exercise of ecclesiastical
                    authority in a synthesis of the concepts underpinning Roman and canon law. The <title>Speculum
                        iudiciale</title> remained an important text for the Catholic church long after the Middle Ages,
                    with several printed editions appearing between the late-fifteenth and mid-seventeenth centuries. MS
                    77 was written in the fourteenth century and an inscription establishes that it was once at the
                    Benedictine abbey of St Albans, Hertfordshire.</p>
