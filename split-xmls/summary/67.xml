                <p>This manuscript contains a commentary on the Psalms which was mistakenly attributed to Remigius of
                    Auxerre (d. 908), now correctly identified as the work of Gilbert de la Porrée - also known as
                    Gilbert of Poitiers (c. 1080-1154). It is a twelfth-century manuscript, with marginalia dating from
                    the thirteenth century to the fifteenth. James suggested a Norwich provenance, although there is no
                    firm evidence for this.</p>
