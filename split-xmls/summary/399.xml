                <p>CCCC MS 399 is a copy of the <title>Prognosticon futuri saeculi</title> by Julian of Toledo (c.
                    642-90) written in northern France probably in the first two thirds of the ninth century. It has
                    some marginal 'tironian notae' - the form of shorthand devised by Cicero's secretary Tiro and
                    revived in the Carolingian period. It seems to have come to England before the end of the tenth
                    century, where some very minor alterations were made to the text. In the twelfth century a decorated
                    opening title page was added. The manuscript was used by Matthew Parker or one of his secretaries,
                    who underlined some significant phrases in red crayon.</p>
