            <div xml:id="CCC253" n="MS 253">
                <p>This twelfth-century manuscript contains copies of Augustine, <title>Confessiones</title>, and the
                    guide to Christian life for soldiers by Ferrandus, deacon of Carthage (d. 546/7). The works by
                    Augustine are in a fine hand, with exceptional illuminated initials. There is, in a twelfth-century
                    hand, a hymn to St Augustine, with music on a three-line stave. There are some late medieval
                    additions at the end of the manuscript. James suggested that CCCC MS 253 originated in Canterbury or
                    Rochester, but this was rejected by Ker and its provenance remains uncertain.</p>
