            <div xml:id="CCC065" n="MS 65">
                <p>CCCC MS 65, dating to the twelfth century, contains a collection of homilies by a variety of
                    patristic authors such as Gregory the Great, Jerome, Bede, etc. Paul the Deacon (c. 720/30-99), a
                    scholar at the court of Charlemagne, compiled such a collection, ordered by appropriate date of the
                    Church year, which travelled widely in the Middle Ages as a useful resource for preachers. This
                    manuscript contains a version of the summer half of Paul the Deacon's collection, and was presumably
                    once accompanied by a winter volume, now lost. The manuscript contains flyleaves with musical
                    notation at the end, a rare survival of English fourteenth-century polyphony, including a four-part
                    Alleluia.</p>
