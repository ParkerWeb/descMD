                        Crist</title>, made for presentation to Henry V probably c. 1420, which is depicted in a
                    miniature at the beginning of the book. The dating of the book is after 1419 when Rouen surrendered
                    to the English and Normandy came under the custody of the uncle of Henry V, Thomas Beaufort, duke of
                    Exeter, who together with the king is mentioned in the presentation inscription. The text is a
                    translation into French by Jean Galopes of the pseudo-Bonaventuran <title>Meditationes uitae
                        Christi</title>, an expanded version of the Gospel account of the life of Christ, whose Latin
                    text has been attributed to John de Caulibus OFM. Jean Galopes was dean of the collegiate church of
                    St Louis de Saulsoye in the diocese of Evreux in Normandy.</p>
