                <p>CCCC MS 142, dating to the fifteenth century, is a copy of translation by Nicholas Love OCarth (d.
                    1423/4) of the pseudo-Bonaventuran <title>Meditationes uitae Christi</title>, an expansion of the
                    Gospel narrative of the life of Christ. This text in both its Latin versions and translations into
                    the vernacular was very popular throughout Europe in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries.
                    Nicholas Love, a Carthusian, was prior of Mount Grace in Yorkshire. His translation of the
                    Meditationes, <title>The Mirrour of the blessyd Lyf of Christ</title>, was submitted for approval to
                    Archbishop Arundel in 1410, and the Memorandum of the licence of approval is in this manuscript.</p>
