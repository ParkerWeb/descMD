                <p>CCCC MS 315 contains thirteenth-century copies of texts relating to the Bible and to the history and
                    geography of the Holy Land, such as an excerpt from Bede's <title>De temporum ratione</title> and
                    his <title>De locis sanctis</title>, Richard of Saint-Victor OSA (d. 1173), <title>In uisionem
                        Ezechielis</title>, and Andrew of Saint-Victor OSA (d. 1175), <title>Expositio hystorica in
                        librum Regum</title>. It is common for works by Bede to be found in manuscripts also containing
                    Andrew's works. Members of the Victorine school focused exclusively on the books of the Old
                    Testament, but while Richard's commentaries are allegorical, Andrew's are historical. It should be
                    noted that the text which was previously thought to be a commentary on Maccabees has now been
                    identified as Andrew's historical Dossier. Van Liere used CCCC MS 315 for his edition of the works
                    of Andrew of Saint-Victor. The manuscript also contains some notes pertaining to a journey during
                    which the writer was at Montpellier and Cologne. An <hi rend="italic">ex libris</hi> inscription
                    identifies the manuscript as having belonged to the Franciscan convent at Oxford.</p>
