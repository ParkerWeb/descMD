                <p>There are a handful of manuscripts in Parker's collection that attest to the Archbishop's interest in
                    alchemy, a subject of great fascination to many of his contemporaries. One such is CCCC MS 99, a
                    collection of alchemical treatises copied in the late fourteenth century. The presence of a number
                    of rough sketches of alchemical instruments and the profusion of stains that litter the manuscript
                    may reveal that at one time this was no theoretical collection, but rather a working textbook. It is
                    not known how this manuscript came into Parker's possession, though M. R. James noted that the
                    triangle inscribed on one of the flyleaves of the manuscript is a symbol often associated with
                    Parker's contemporary, John Dee (1527-1608).</p>
