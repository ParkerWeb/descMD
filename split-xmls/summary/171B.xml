                <p>CCCC MS 171, divided into two parts, A and B, since James' description in 1912, contains Walter
                    Bower's <title>Scotichronicon</title> by Walter Bower (1385-1449), a history of the kingdom of
                    Scotland beginning with its foundation with the arrival of Scota, daughter of an Egyptian pharaoh.
                    This chronicle was a continuation and expansion of the <title>Chronica gentis Scotorum</title> by
                    John Fordun (d. after 1363). The manuscript was written c. 1447-9 at the Augustinian abbey of
                    Inchcolm in Fife and was amended under the direction of Bower himself, abbot of Inchcolm (d. 1449).
                    It is considered to be one of the most important texts of late medieval Scottish historical writing
                    in existence and was used as the basis for the nine-volume edition of the text published under the
                    general editorship of D. E. R. Watt. There are a few coloured full and half-page drawings of major
                    narrative events such as the Battle of Bannockburn and the Coronation and funeal of Alexander III.
                    It is not known how this manuscript came to be in Parker's collection.</p>
