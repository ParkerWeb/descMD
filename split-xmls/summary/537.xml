                <p>CCCC MS 537, probably made in Prague, contains a great number of late fourteenth- or early
                    fifteenth-century extracts and copies of devotional and liturgical texts. These include the
                        <title>Oratio circa elevationem missae</title> by Jan Isner (d. 1411) on f. 54v (also in <ref
                        type="ms" target="CCC500">CCCC MS 500</ref>, f. 11r) , numerous prayers, including some
                    attributed to Augustine and one from the <title>Stimulus amoris</title> by James of Milan OFM (fl.
                    c. 1296). The book retains its original binding. This volume is part of the Elbing collection; a
                    group of manuscripts which belonged to a Brigittine convent at Elbing (Elblag), near Gdansk. The
                    collection was donated to Corpus Christi College by either Richard Pernham (1583?-1628) or his wife
                    Mary, whose name is in many of these books.</p>
