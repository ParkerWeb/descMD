                <p>CCCC MS 497 has been catalogued as a printed book, though James noted that it was in a
                    seventeenth-century Italian hand. It contains a copy of <title>De cabala sacra et de ineffabili Dei
                        nomine Tetragrammaton</title> dedicated to Philip IV of Spain and dated 1623. It is bound in a
                    handsome binding which depicts the arms of Philip in gold. This book was donated to the college by
                    Henry Flitcroft. Whether this figure is to be identified with the renowned Palladian architect of
                    the same name (d. 1769) is not certain.</p>
