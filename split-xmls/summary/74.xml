                <p>CCCC MS 74 contains a fourteenth-century copy of the <title>Inuentarium iuris canonici</title> of
                    Berengarius Fredoli (d. 1323), an index of subjects written as a guide to canon law. Parker acquired
                    this manuscript from Norwich Cathedral Priory and it was one of three that the priory had been
                    bequeathed by their former owner, Cardinal Adam Easton (c. 1330-97), that Parker secured (see also
                    CCCC MSS <ref type="ms" target="CCC180">180</ref> and <ref type="ms" target="CCC347">347</ref>). It
                    was almost certainly once part of the Cardinal's reputedly extensive personal library. If so, it was
                    probably among the 228 books from that source which arrived in Norwich, packed in six barrels, in
                    1407, ten years after his death in Rome.</p>
