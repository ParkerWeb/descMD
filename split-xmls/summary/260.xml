                <p>CCCC MS 260 was written towards the end of the tenth century at Christ Church, Canterbury. It
                    contains copies of important early medieval treatises on music, most significantly the <title>Musica
                        enchiriadis</title> and <title>Scholica enchiriadis</title>, which usually travelled together.
                    Both must be considered essentially anonymous, despite the fact that the <title>Musica
                        enchiriadis</title> is in this manuscript attributed to Hoger of Laon (d. 930); in the Corpus
                    catalogue James attributed them to Hucbald of Saint-Amand (d. c. 930) and Odo of Cluny OSB (c.
                    879-942) respectively. Together they provide some of the earliest evidence for polyphony, and use a
                    type of notation known as Dasian, which allows for precise pitch to be recorded. Parker wrote "TW"
                    in this manuscript, perhaps to indicate that he acquired it from John Twyne, a Canterbury
                    schoolmaster and antiquary who had worked at St Augustine's before the Dissolution; or
                    alternatively, from Thomas Wotton (c. 1521-87), nephew of Nicholas Wotton dean of Canterbury, and an
                    associate of Parker with Puritan sympathies.</p>
