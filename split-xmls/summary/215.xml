                <p>CCCC MS 215 and <ref type="ms" target="CCC216">CCCC MS 216</ref> are the autograph manuscripts of the
                    Postils of John Boys (1571-1625). They were originally printed in small volumes between 1609 and
                    1616 and then, after the author's death, they were reprinted as <hi rend="italic">The workes of Iohn
                        Boys Doctor in Divinitie and Deane of Canterburie</hi> (London, 1622). <ref type="ms"
                        target="CCC216">MS 216</ref> equates to pages 1-456 and MS 215 equates to pages 457-988 in this
                    latter, complete edition. Images of the printed editions are available on Early English Books
                    On-Line at http://eebo.chadwyck.com. The limp vellum bindings are extremely fragile and it has not
                    been possible to image the text content, but the exterior binding has been photographed. The
                    manuscripts were donated to Corpus Christi by the author's nephew Edward Boys in 1641.</p>
