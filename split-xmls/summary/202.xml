                <p>Sections of CCCC MS 202 date from the late twelfth century, and others from the thirteenth. In the
                    first part of the manuscript, the thirteenth-century material includes seven lines of moral notes as
                    well as the provisions of a Church Council relating to monastic affairs. The late twelfth-century
                    material is largely Classical or Late Antique, including introductory material on Sidonius
                    Apollinaris and Fulgentius, and the florilegium of the letters of Symmachus. The second part of the
                    manuscript, possibly thirteenth century, contains a copy of Proverbs and Ecclesiastes, with
                    extensive marginal and interlinear glosses.</p>
