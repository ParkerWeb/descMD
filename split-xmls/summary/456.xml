                <p>CCCC MS 456 is a late fourteenth-century manuscript that contains miscellaneous texts, some of them
                    scientific. These include Iohannes de Sacro Bosco (fl. early thirteenth century), <title>Tractatus
                        de sphaera</title>, the treatise by Richard of Bury (1281-1345) on the collection and study of
                    books, the <title>Philobiblon</title>, Alexander de Villa Dei (c. 1170-c. 1240)
                        <title>Algorismus</title>, and the Latin translation of the Arabic version of the
                        <title>Secretum secretorum</title> by Philip of Tripoli (fl. c. 1243), which is also in <ref
                        type="ms" target="CCC407">CCCC MS 407</ref>. This last work, popular in the later Middle Ages,
                    is a compilation of advice on political and ethical matters directed towards rulers. In addition,
                    there are three anonymous astronomical and mathematical treatises. Of all of these texts, it was
                    surely Richard of Bury's <title>Philobiblon</title> that attracted Parker to this manuscript, since
                    the Archbishop and the erstwhile bishop of Durham shared a love of books not simply for their
                    contents, but as objects in themselves.</p>
