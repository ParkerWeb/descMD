                <p>CCCC MS 92 contains a copy of the <title>Chronica chronicarum</title> (<title>Chronicon ex
                        chronicis</title>) of John of Worcester (d. c. 1140), from the Creation to 1131 with later,
                    anonymous, additions that take the <title>Chronica</title> up to the late thirteenth century. Once
                    attributed to Florence of Worcester (d. 1118), it is now known that, using the existing chronicles
                    of Marianus Scotus and Eadmer of Canterbury as the basis for his work, John compiled the
                        <title>Chronica</title>, adding numerous details of English history. This manuscript of the text
                    was produced at Abingdon Abbey in the third quarter of the twelfth century, but was later at
                    Peterborough Abbey, from where it presumably passed into Parker's collection.</p>
