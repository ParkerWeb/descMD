                <p>CCCC MS 388 is a compendium of medical treatises and recipes including works attributed to
                    Hippocrates, Galen, Scelpius and 'H. Sampsonis de Clouburnel'. The contents are written in English,
                    Latin and Anglo-Norman and were copied c. 1330. As such, it throws an interesting light on the
                    creation and transmission of multi-lingual texts in later medieval England. An analysis of the
                    Middle English components of this volume suggests that it was written or copied by an author who
                    employed a linguistic style that has been localised to East Anglia in the vicinity of Ely. Other
                    than this, there are no clues as to the manuscript's provenance.</p>
