                <p>CCCC MS 304 is a very important early copy of Juvencus, <title>Euangelia metrica</title>, a metrical
                    paraphrase of the gospels in Virgilian language composed in the fourth century by this aristocratic
                    Spanish priest. It also contains the earliest known version of some verses by Isidore of Seville (c.
                    560-636). This manuscript was written in the first half of the eighth century in Uncial script. E.
                    A. Lowe changed his mind about this manuscript between the two editions of the second volume of his
                        <title>Codices Latini Antiquiores</title>: in the first he considered it to be Spanish, in the
                    second Italian. It seems to have reached England by the tenth century, perhaps at Christ Church,
                    Canterbury or Malmesbury, and may be identifiable with an item in the Christ Church library
                    catalogue.</p>
