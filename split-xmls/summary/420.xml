                <p>CCCC MS 420 is a compendium of astrological and astronomical tracts. Of these, Johannes Stoeffler's
                        <title>Ephemerides</title> and the translation by Peter of Abano (c. 1257-1316) into Latin of
                    Abraham ibn Ezra's astrological treatise <title>Re'shit Ho'khmah</title> - the <title>Liber
                        introductorius in iudicia astrorum qui dicitur Principium sapientiae</title> are printed
                    versions produced in Parker's lifetime. The first portion of the collection contains various
                    manuscript tracts in Latin and English copied in the sixteenth century, the first of which is the
                    preface to the <title>Prognosticatio</title> of Johannes Lichtenberger (d. 1503). The name John
                    Eston appears in two places in the volume, though he and his relationship to Parker, if any, has not
                    been identified.</p>
