                <p>CCCC MS 405 was formed from several manuscripts dating from the early thirteenth century and the
                    early fourteenth century. It once belonged to the Knights Hospitallers' (the Knights of the Hospital
                    of St. John of Jerusalem) temple at Kilbarry, near Waterford in Ireland and contains an Irish
                    monastic calendar, liturgical offices, a collection of texts and verses, predominantly in
                    Anglo-Norman, and numerous transcribed documents, mainly in Latin, relating to the Knights
                    Hospitallers and the borough of Waterford. The volume has been used as evidence of the wide usage of
                    Anglo-Norman in Ireland and to demonstrate the variety of tracts available to Ireland's monastic
                    communities as well as being an important source regarding the city of Waterford due to the civic
                    documents which are included in the manuscript.</p>
