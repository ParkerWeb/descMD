                <p>CCCC MS 475 is a copy of Zacharias of Besançon OPrem, <title>De concordia euangelistarum</title>
                        (<title>Vnum ex quatuor</title>), a Gospel-harmony which also gives etymologies for Greek,
                    Hebrew and some Latin words. Zacharias, who died in 1156, was a member of the Premonstratensian
                    abbey at Laon. James proposed a date for the manuscript in the first half of the twelfth century,
                    which would represent a very early stage in the manuscript transmission of the text; however, Gerits
                    suggested that the manuscript might be as late as the thirteenth century.</p>
