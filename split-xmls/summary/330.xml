                <p>CCCC MS 330 consists of two parts. Although they are appropriately associated since one contains a
                    gloss on the text found in the other, they were originally separate manuscripts. The first part,
                    written either in Normandy or in England probably in the early twelfth century, contains the
                        <title>De nuptiis Philologiae et Mercurii</title> by the late antique author, Martianus Capella.
                    It has an <hi rend="italic">ex libris</hi> inscription of Malmesbury abbey, and contains writing in
                    the hand of William of Malmesbury OSB (c. 1080-1143). It may have been William himself who combined
                    it with the second part, which contains a commentary on Martianus Capella probably either by Dunchad
                    (9th century) or Martin of Laon. The same text is found in <ref type="ms" n="CCC153">CCCC MS
                        153</ref>. This second part was written on the Continent in the late ninth century (although
                    Bischoff does not mention it in his catalogue of ninth-century manuscripts, which may mean he
                    thought it later), but it was probably brought to England relatively early.</p>
