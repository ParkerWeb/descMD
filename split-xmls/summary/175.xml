                <p>CCCC MS 175 contains a copy of an historical compilation called the Memoriale commonly attributed to
                    Walter of Coventry who was writing in the second half of the thirteenth century, the period in which
                    this manuscript of his text was written. In addition, the first few leaves of the manuscript are
                    taken up with a range of historical notes, extracts and genealogical tables, some relating to the
                    archdiocese of York. The manuscript was almost certainly in the hands of the Tudor poet and
                    antiquary John Leland (1506-1552), who thought it was in poor condition - '<title>Codex erat aliquot
                        locis mancus</title>'. The historian John Bale (1495-1563) saw the manuscript in Leland's
                    collection, but Parker must have acquired it some time before 1572 (possibly from the Cheapside
                    resident William Carye), since the text was used as the basis for the archbishop's
                        <title>Antiquitates</title> published in that year. The manuscript was copied many time in the
                    course of the sixteenth, seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the details it supplied about church
                    government in Angevin England being keenly studied by church historians.</p>
