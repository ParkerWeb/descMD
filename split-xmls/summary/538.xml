                <p>The writing in CCCC MS 538 is much faded and its contemporary binding was in a very damaged state but
                    was repaired in the twentieth century. It was probably written at some time after 1396/7 in Bohemia.
                    On f. 13r the ownership is recorded of Johannes Mokelburg B.A. who had studied at Prague. A Heinrich
                    Mokelburg of Elbing is recorded in 1419 as a student at Leipzig. The book contains one work, a <hi
                        rend="italic">summa</hi> of catholic doctrine by Conradus of Soltau (Zolco or Zolto, c.
                    1350-1407), the <title>Commentary on Firmiter credimus</title> (<title>Summa de trinitate et fide
                        catholica</title>). At the end of this work is a colophon attributing it to Zolto, doctor of
                    Prague, who compiled it in 1396/97. The text is also in <ref type="ms" target="CCC529">CCCC MS
                        529</ref>. This volume is part of the Elbing collection, a group of manuscripts which belonged
                    to the Brigittine convent at Elbing (Elblag), near Gdansk. The collection was donated to Corpus
                    Christi College by either Richard Pernham (1583?-1628) or his wife Mary, whose name is in many of
                    these books.</p>
