                <p>CCCC MS 407 contains two distinct types of material, but all copied in the second quarter of the
                    fourteenth century. The first is a series of travelogues including Simon Simeonis OFM (d. after
                    1322) <title>Itinerarium in terram sanctam</title>, Willelmus de Rubruk OFM (c. 1215-c. 1270)
                        <title>Itinerarium ad partes orientales</title> and the <title>Itinerarium</title> of Odoricus
                    of Pordenone (c. 1286-1331). The second type of material, written in a different hand, includes the
                    Arabic version of the <title>Secretum secretorum</title> translated by Philip of Tripoli (fl. c.
                    1243) and another broadly medical treatise, <title>De complexione humana</title>. This volume was
                    owned by, and quite probably copied for, Simon Bozoun OSB (d. 1352), prior of Norwich Cathedral
                    Priory, as revealed by an inscription on the first folio. The manuscript was almost certainly
                    acquired by Parker from Norwich.</p>
