                <p>CCCC MS 544, contains a fifteenth-century copy of William Lyndwood (d. 1446) <title>Constitutiones
                        prouinciales</title>, although this version lacks Lyndwood's glosses to the same text. This very
                    popular text is a digest of the synodal constitutions of the province of Canterbury from 1222 to
                    1416. The manuscript was never part of Parker's collection but rather was purchased from the
                    trustees of the Rev. J. C. Bowen of Banbury in May 1932. Bowen had unfortunately gone mad, his only
                    request for reading matter during his confinement being this manuscript, which request was refused
                    on account of the threat that he would damage it.</p>
