            <div xml:id="CCC314" n="MS 314">
                <p>CCCC MS 314 contains a number of texts pertaining to the mystical theology of pseudo-Dionysius,
                    including Latin translations of his works on the Celestial Hierarchy and the Divine Names. The
                    manuscript also contains commentaries on pseudo-Dionysius by Hugh of Saint-Victor OSA (c. 1096-1141)
                    and Thomas Gallus (Vercellensis) OSA (d. 1246), as well as a number of other commentaries by Gallus,
                    including one on the Song of Songs. The Latin translation of pseudo-Dionysius, <title>De caelesti
                        hierarchia</title> is that by John Scotus Eriugena (9th century); the text also includes two
                    poems by Eriugena, but they are textually corrupt and were not used for Herren's edition. The
                    manuscript is of late thirteenth- or early fourteenth-century date, and is from the Benedictine
                    abbey of St Augustine's, Canterbury.</p>
