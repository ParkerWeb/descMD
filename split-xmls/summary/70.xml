            <div xml:id="CCC070" n="MS 70">
                <p>CCCC MS 70 contains a number of Anglo-Saxon, Norman and Plantagenet legal tracts, including the text
                    of the <title>Quadripartitus</title> and the <title>Leges Henrici Primi</title>. It was written by
                    or for Andrew Horn (c. 1275-1328) in the first quarter of the fourteenth century, probably to serve
                    as a private compilation of precedents able to inform any discussions of the customs of the City of
                    London. It is one of the manuscripts that Horn, a prominent City fishmonger and Chamberlain of
                    London (1320-28), bequeathed to the London Guildhall and was at one time almost certainly bound up
                    with the material that is now contained in <ref type="ms" target="CCC258">CCCC MS 258</ref>. This
                    provenance is neatly established by the presence within the manuscript of a drawing of a fish
                    accompanied by the words '<title>Horn mihi cognomen Andreas est mihi nomen</title>'.</p>
