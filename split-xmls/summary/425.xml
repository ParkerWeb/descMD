                <p>CCCC MS 425 consists of two once-separate volumes. The first contains the unique surviving copies of
                    two hagiographical works by Gerald of Wales (1146-1226), his lives of St Remigius and St Hugh. It
                    has been suggested that the manuscript could be an autograph, and on these grounds has been located
                    to Lincoln between 1209 and 1223. The second volume is a c. 1450 copy of letters of Peter of Blois
                    (d. 1212). The two were probably combined by Matthew Parker. He added a table of contents and the
                    initials "TW" to the start of the first volume, perhaps suggesting that he acquired it from one of
                    the Twynes or from Thomas Wootton.</p>
