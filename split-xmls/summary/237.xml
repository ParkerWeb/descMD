                <p>CCCC MS 237 is a copy, made in England, dating to c. 1500, of the Commentary (or Meditation) of
                    Girolamo Savonarola (1452-98) on Psalm 50 (51), <title>Miserere mei Deus</title>, and Psalm 30 (31),
                        <title>In te Domine speravi</title>. The Dominican preacher wrote this text while in prison in
                    Florence in 1498, charged with heresy, and having been found guilty was burned at the stake in that
                    year. The manuscript has on the first page a decorative illuminated border in English style.
                    Savonarola's Meditation on these two psalms was much read during the Reformation period in England,
                    although this copy antedates that time by at least thirty years.</p>
