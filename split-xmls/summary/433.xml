            <div xml:id="CCC433" n="MS 433">
                <p>CCCC MS 433 is a manuscript containing a miscellany of texts copied in a number of hands between the
                    thirteenth and the late fifteenth centuries. Among the notable or characteristic items in this
                    volume are two Cluniac chronicles, one with much interest in affairs in the Welsh marches. The
                    volume also contains the tract <title>De miseria humanae conditionis</title> by Pope Innocent III
                    (1160/6-1219 - pope 1198-1216), the fable <title>De Mauro bubulco</title>, a version of the
                        <title>Miracula Sanctae Milburgae</title>, as well as a treatise on the sacraments and a number
                    of sermons. The Cluniac material has led to some speculation that this manuscript may be linked to
                    the Cluniac house of St Milburga at Much Wenlock, Shropshire, though this has been disputed.</p>
