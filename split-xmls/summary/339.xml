                <p>CCCC MS 339 contains two distinct volumes, the first of which has been claimed by some as the
                    autograph working copy of the <title>Chronicon de tempore regis Ricardi</title> by Richard of
                    Devizes OSB (fl. late twelfth century), a monk of Winchester, and the <title>Annales
                        Wintonienses</title>. The second volume contains a fourteenth-century copy of the
                        <title>Compilatio de gestis Britonum et Anglorum</title> by Peter of Ickham OSB (d. 1295). The
                    provenance of this manuscript is uncertain. The earlier portion of the codex may have been produced
                    at the Benedictine cathedral priory of St Peter, St Paul, and St Swithun at Winchester, around 1200,
                    while an early fifteenth-century note appended to the second volume is concerned with events in the
                    Augustinian abbey of the Blessed Virgin at Lilleshall in Shropshire. Neither of these provenances
                    have been wholly accepted The manuscript may once have been in the hands of the historian John Bale
                    (1495-1563) before it came into Parker's possession.</p>
