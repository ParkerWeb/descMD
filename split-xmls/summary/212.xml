                <p>CCCC MS 212 dates from the late twelfth century. The manuscript contains sermons attributed to
                    Gibuinus of Troyes (d. c.1150) and Petrus Comestor (d. c. 1187). The manuscript is written in
                    several fine hands, and the decoration includes attractive initials and some zoo-anthropomorphic
                    figures in coloured outline. It has been suggested that, late in the Middle Ages, the manuscript may
                    have been part of the library of the Brigittine abbey of Syon in Middlesex. It is bound in an old
                    limp vellum binding. As a result of the fragility of this binding it has only been possible to image
                    the exterior and interior of the covers and part of the text pages, ff. 1r-152r.</p>
