                <p> The <title>Corpus Glossary</title>, CCCC MS 144, written in the early ninth century, is an early
                    witness to the Old English language, and also attests to Latin learning in England at this time. It
                    contains several glossaries; most of the glosses are in Latin, but there are over 2000 in Old
                    English. It is written in a beautiful Anglo-Saxon Hybrid Minuscule, with some typically Insular
                    decoration of initials. The manuscript also has two flyleaves at the end from an Irish manuscript of
                    a treatise on grammar by Priscian (fl. c. 500) written in Gaelic National Hand, probably in the
                    twelfth century.</p>
