                <p>This manuscript contains works by, or attributed to, Ambrose (c. 339-97) on the theme of virginity,
                    and on the virtues and vices. The manuscript seems to have been written at St Augustine's,
                    Canterbury, although the script, and the fine decorated initials with brightly coloured grounds, are
                    more usually associated with Christ Church. The same scribe's hand can be seen in <ref type="ms"
                        target="CCC094">CCCC MS 94</ref> and <ref type="ms" target="CCC270">CCCC MS 270</ref>. James
                    thought that the manuscript was written in the eleventh century, although recent scholars have
                    proposed a twelfth-century date, perhaps as late as 1140. The thematic concerns of the manuscript,
                    particularly the focus on chastity, might place its compilation within an ecclesiastical reform
                    context.</p>
