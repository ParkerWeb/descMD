                <p>These eight leaves, CCCC MS 641, from a Spanish sixteenth-century Antiphoner of the use of Rome of
                    much larger size than the single leaf, <ref type="ms" target="CCC640">CCCC MS 640</ref>, were given
                    to the Parker Library by Andrew Johnson in 2008. The texts are from Lauds of Maundy Thursday, Matins
                    of Good Friday and Matins of Holy Saturday, but as some leaves are missing the text is not complete.
                    There are large calligraphic and coloured initials tinted in pale yellow for the responsories and
                    versicles.</p>
