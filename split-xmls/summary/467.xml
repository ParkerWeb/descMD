            <div xml:id="CCC467" n="MS 467">
                <p>CCCC MS 467 is a fifteenth-century copy of the <title>Life of St Thomas Becket</title> by John
                    Grandisson (d. 1369), also found in <ref type="ms" target="CCC275">CCCC MSS 275</ref> and <ref
                        type="ms" target="CCC464">464</ref>. It has some decorated initials. The manuscript has an
                    inscription saying that it was given to Robert Hare (d. 1611) by John Swift, auditor (d. 1570). It
                    had presumably passed into the hands of Matthew Parker before 1575. Hare was a recusant - he gave
                    the famous manuscript by Thomas Elmham OSB (d. c. 1427) to Trinity Hall (MS 1) in Cambridge on
                    condition that it was returned to St Augustine's Canterbury if it was ever rebuilt - and his
                    antiquarian links with scholars such as Parker, Arthur Agarde, John Stow, etc, shed an interesting
                    light on the friendly scholarly relations which could exist between Protestants and Roman Catholics
                    at this time.</p>
