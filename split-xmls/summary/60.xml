            <div xml:id="CCC060" n="MS 60">
                <p>CCCC MS 60 contains a copy of the <title>Memoriale historiarum</title>, a chronicle with particular
                    emphasis on France, attributed to John of Paris (d. 1306) (or sometimes John of Saint-Victor), who
                    is also called Jean Boyvin in the description of a late fifteenth- or early sixteenth-century copy
                    of the same text now in the Bibliothèque Sainte-Geneviève in Paris (MS 516). The Corpus manuscript
                    is copied in a late fourteenth-century hand and is accompanied by a genealogy tracing the descent of
                    Edward III from the French royal family, presumably part of the English propaganda campaign of the
                    Hundred Years' War. Parker gave a version of the <title>Memoriale</title> to Cambridge University
                    Library (now CUL MS Ii. 2. 18) and a copy was reportedly in the library of Sir Walter Cope (c.
                    1553-1614), gentleman usher to Parker's colleague in government, William Cecil, Lord Burghley.</p>
