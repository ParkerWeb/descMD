                <p>MS 360 contains a collection of sermons compiled by John Felton (d. 1434). Linguistic analysis of the
                    oldest manuscripts of this work have been used to argue that John Felton was from the north of
                    England, possibly Northumberland. He is first recorded as the vicar of Melchbourne, Bedfordshire in
                    1390 and in 1397 became the vicar of St Mary Magdalen, Oxford, where he remained for the rest of his
                    life. His sermon collection is largely a compilation of notes from the model sermons available at
                    the time. It was originally compiled in 1431, with this manuscript dating to the middle of the
                    fifteenth century. The popularity of the work is attested to by the number of surviving
                    manuscripts.</p>
