                <p>CCCC MS 372 contains a late fourteenth-century copy one of the most popular chronicles of the
                    medieval period, the <title>Chronica pontificum et imperatorum</title> by Martin of Troppau OP
                    (before 1230-1278), a history of the Roman emperors and the papacy. Martin's work was extremely
                    influential on the work of other chroniclers, including English writers, and it is not to be
                    wondered that Parker possessed more than one copy of the work (see <ref type="ms" target="CCC059"
                        >CCCC MS 59</ref>, <ref type="ms" target="CCC194">194</ref>). In addition, this manuscript
                    contains a number of later fifteenth-century additions, including a list of tithes and a royal writ,
                    which seem to indicate that this manuscript was once connected to Suffolk. Beyond that, nothing is
                    known of this manuscript's provenance or how it came to be in Parker's collection.</p>
