                <p>CCCC MS 557 consists of two fragments of eleventh-century Old English material removed from the
                    bindings of two Parkerian printed books. Two further fragments from the same manuscript were removed
                    from printed books in the collection of the Kenneth Spencer Research Library at the University of
                    Kansas. The text is an Old English sermon on the True Cross. It has later annotations by the
                    Tremulous Hand of Worcester, and was probably also written there.</p>
