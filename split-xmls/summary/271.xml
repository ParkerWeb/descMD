                <p>CCCC MS 271 was in the library of St Augustine's, Canterbury, where it once comprised two separate
                    volumes that were first bound together in the fourteenth century. The first volume, containing the
                        <title>Decretales</title> of Gregory IX, was donated to the abbey by a monk of St Augustine's,
                    Martin de Totynton (fl. c. 1300), while the second part, containing the <title>Decretals</title> of
                    Boniface VIII (<title>Liber sextus</title>), was donated by one 'Abbot T.'. This is probably abbot
                    Thomas Findon (1283-1310) or possibly Thomas Poucyn (1334-43). A fourteenth-century hand has added
                    the <title>Constitutions</title> of Archbishops Langton, Boniface and Pecham to the second volume.
                    It presumably found its way into Parker's collection from St Augustine's.</p>
