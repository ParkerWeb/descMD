                <p>CCCC MS 19 contains a copy of Ivo of Chartres' (c. 1040-1115) <title>Decretum (in 17 parts)</title>,
                    an influential canon law collection. The version of the text in this manuscript was copied at Christ
                    Church, Canterbury in around 1130 by a scribe whose hand has also been identified in Cambridge,
                    Trinity College, MS B. 3. 4 (83), Cambridge, UL MS Ff. 3. 29, and Oxford, Bodleian MSS Lat. misc. d.
                    13 and Lat misc. d. 30. It has recently been suggested that the absence of any later canonical
                    material in this codex may indicate that it was a library copy of the <title>Decretum</title> rather
                    than a working volume. It is also one of only two manuscripts (the other being Durham Cathedral
                    Library MS B.IV.18) to preserve the 'Canterbury version' of the canons of the First Lateran Council
                    of 1123.</p>
