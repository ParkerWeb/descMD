                <p>The copy of the <title>Thebaid</title> by the Roman poet, Statius (c. 45-c. 96), was donated to
                    Corpus Christi College by the scholar, poet and diplomat, Daniel Rogers (c. 1538-91). The manuscript
                    of the late twelfth or early thirteenth century is either French or English. It has some notations
                    in the margins. This epic poem is about the attack on the city of Thebes by the seven leaders of
                    Argos, and is a reworking of an ancient Greek epic now mostly lost. The text was of interest in the
                    Middle Ages, used as a source for the twelfth-century French romance, <title>Le Roman de
                        Thèbes</title>, and by Boccaccio and Chaucer.</p>
