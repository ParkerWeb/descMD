            <div xml:id="CCC283" n="MS 283">
                <p>CCCC MS 283 contains a late fourteenth-century copy of <title>De regimine principum</title> by Giles
                    of Rome OESA (c. 1243-1316) as well as a twelfth-century translation of Arabic astronomical tables
                    by Adelard of Bath (c. 1080-c. 1150). There has been some dispute as to its provenance, with M. R.
                    James and more recent scholars agreeing that it may once have been at Norwich Holy Trinity cathedral
                    priory, while Neil Ker rejected this idea. A letter from John de Mowbray (1415-61), 3rd duke of
                    Norfolk, to Thomas, bishop of Norwich, is copied in a different hand onto f. 159v and presumably
                    dates originally from c. 1436-45, when Thomas Brunce served as bishop. There is a small illustration
                    of Giles of Rome on f. 1r.</p>
