                <p>CCCC MS 518, made in Prague, is part of the Elbing collection brought back from the abandoned
                    Brigittine monastery at what is now Elblag near Gdansk Poland by Richard Pernham (1583?-1628) in the
                    early 1620s and donated to Corpus Christi either by himself or by his wife Mary, whose name is
                    inscribed in many books of the collection. Like many manuscripts in this collection, this codex
                    consists of a collection of devotional and theological tracts copied in a number of late
                    fourteenth-century hands. These include extracts from the <title>Compendium ueritatis
                        theologicae</title> by Hugo Ripelinus (Hugh of Strasbourg) OP (c. 1200-68), <title>Soliloquium
                        de arra animae</title> by Hugh of Saint-Victor OSA (c. 1096–1141), the <title>De occultatione
                        uitiorum sub specie uirtutum</title> and <title>Tractatus de quatuor instinctibus</title>
                    attributed to Heinrich von Friemar (Henricus de Frimaria) OESA (1250-1340), the <title>De miseria
                        humanae conditionis</title> by Innocent III (1160/61-1216), and the <title>Quaestiones
                        sentenciarum</title> by Petrus de Aquila OFM (d. 1361), a commentary on the
                        <title>Sentences</title> of Peter Lombard (c. 1095-1160). This last item ends with a note that
                    it was written in Prague in 1376.</p>
