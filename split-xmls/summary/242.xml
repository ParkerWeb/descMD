                <p>CCCC MS 242 is a mid-sixteenth-century collection assembled by William Buckmaster (d. 1546), who
                    became the vice-chancellor of Cambridge University in 1529. The manuscript contains a collection of
                    documents relating to Cambridge University during the period 1528-44 and a catalogue of English
                    saints and kings. The manuscript was not a part of Archbishop Parker's collection, but was donated
                    to the college by John Jegon sometime after 1592 when he acquired it.</p>
