                <p>CCCC MS 452 contains the <title>Historia nouorum in Anglia</title> of Eadmer of Canterbury OSB (d.
                    after 1124), copied in the first half of the twelfth century, after 1122, at Christ Church,
                    Canterbury. It probably once formed part of what is now <ref type="ms" target="CCC371">CCCC MS
                        371</ref>, and it has been speculated that Eadmer himself may have removed the
                        <title>Historia</title> from this other contemporary collection of his works. The
                        <title>Historia</title> is an account of English history from the Conquest to 1122 and it
                    preserves a large amount of ecclesiastical history of this period that Parker and successive
                    generations of historians of the Church have found extremely useful. Presumably, Parker acquired
                    this manuscript more or less directly from Christ Church. After its acquisition a thirteenth-century
                    miniature of <title>Noli me tangere</title> was inserted, probably cut from French psalter.</p>
