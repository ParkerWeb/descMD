                <p>CCCC MS 181, copied in the early fourteenth century, contains the <title>Gesta Normannorum
                        ducum</title> compiled by William of Jumièges OSB (d. 1087?), Orderic Vitalis OSB (1075-c.1143)
                    and Robert de Torigni OSB (d. 1186), Torigni's distinct <title>Chronicon</title> for the years 1137
                    onwards, continued by a later author to 1259, as well as a number of shorter texts of continental,
                    particularly Norman and French, history. This codex also contains two well-known pieces of medieval
                    travel literature about the far east, Willelmus de Rubruk OFM (fl. 1248-57) <title>Itinerarium ad
                        partes orientales</title> and Iohannes de Plano Carpini (c. 1182-c. 1252) <title>Historia
                        mongolorum quos nos tartaros appellamus</title>. A shelf mark indicates that this volume is one
                    of two in Parker's collection that can be shown to have once been in the library of the Benedictine
                    Abbey of St Mary's, York (the other being <ref type="ms" target="CCC309">CCCC MS 309</ref>). How
                    this manuscript came into Parker's possession is not known.</p>
