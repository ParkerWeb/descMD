            <div xml:id="CCC037" n="MS 37">
                <p>CCCC MS 37 is an interesting portmanteau manuscript of texts copied by various hands in the first
                    half of the fourteenth century. The overwhelming sense of the these texts is of a collection put
                    together by or for a secular figure with connections to London and Westminster. They include a
                    gazetteer of England, astrological and medical tracts, statutes and calendars of the term days of
                    the Exchequer and illustrated guides to the movement of the moon and tides. The London connection is
                    further evinced by the presence in the manuscript of unique accounts of some of the cases that came
                    before the eyre of 1321 that examined the liberties of the City. It may have been the property of
                    the Londoner John Reynham and passed from him, via a relative, to the Cistercian abbey at Boxley,
                    Kent.</p>
