            <div xml:id="CCC075" n="MS 75">
                <p>This large glossed Psalter, CCCC MS 75, dating to c. 1220, contains the commentary of Peter Lombard
                    (c. 1095-1160) completed towards the end of his life in 1158/9. This was the most read of all
                    commentaries on the psalms in the later centuries of the Middle Ages. This is a luxury copy with
                    historiated initials placed at the liturgical divisions of the psalms, even though this book was
                    intended for scholarly rather than liturgical use. The iconography of these initials is
                    characteristic of the specifically English system used in the thirteenth century, although some of
                    them, like Noah's drunkenness for psalm 51, are rarely found. M. R. James suggested that the script
                    was characteristic of the abbey of St Albans, but the study by Thomson of St Albans books of this
                    period rejects it. It might have been made in East Anglia because it is illuminated by the same
                    artists as the Psalter, London, BL MS Lansdowne 431, which was made for an Augustinian house in that
                    region, perhaps Barnwell near Cambridge.</p>
