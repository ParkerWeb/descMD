                <p>CCCC MS 190 is a very complex and interesting volume, with multiple layers of additions and
                    alterations. It was made over the course of the eleventh century, with at least some parts written
                    at Exeter, where it has later provenance. At its core is a version of the collection known as
                    "Archbishop Wulfstan's Handbook", a miscellany on largely ecclesiastical matters which seems to have
                    been compiled by Wulfstan (d. 1023), archbishop of York, for use in his composition of law codes and
                    homilies. This occupies most of pp. 1-294, and has a contemporary contents list which does not,
                    however, correspond precisely to the volume's actual contents. It is in Latin, and has a number of
                    interesting additions like a text assigning penances to those who had fought at the Battle of
                    Hastings (1066). The second part of the book has many Old English texts, including translations of
                    some of the material which is found in the first part, and more ecclesiastical material of a similar
                    nature, such as law codes. The manuscript was valued by Parker for its insights into the Anglo-Saxon
                    church.</p>
