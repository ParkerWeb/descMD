                <p>There are two apparently unconnected works in CCCC MS 436, dating from c. 1400. The first is a
                    commentary on the Apocalypse attributed in the manuscript to Hugo de Vienna, but in fact by an
                    unknown author, pseudo-Hugh of Saint-Cher, so called because his Apocalypse commentary with the
                    incipit <title>Vidit Iacob in sompnis</title> is sometimes attributed to Hugh of Saint-Cher OP (c.
                    1200-63) to whom several commentaries on that book are misattributed. The second text is a Latin
                    tract by John Wyclif (d. 1384), <title>De officio pastorali</title>.</p>
