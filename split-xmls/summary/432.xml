            <div xml:id="CCC432" n="MS 432">
                <p>CCCC MS 432 contains a late thirteenth-century copy of the <title>Chronique de Reims</title> (or
                        <title>Rains</title>) a history of the third crusade written in French. This copy, whose
                    illustrations have suffered a great deal of damage, bears a versified inscription by John Skelton
                    (d. 1529), written on the occasion of the manuscript's presentation to Henry VIII, Skelton's pupil.
                    Presumably it came into Parker's possession as a result of his contact either with the Henrician or
                    Elizabethan court, but the manuscript's exact route from the royal collection into Parker's is
                    unknown. The book contains eleven illuminated miniatures and two historiated initials, all much
                    damaged.</p>
