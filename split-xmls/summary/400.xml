            <div xml:id="CCC400" n="MS 400">
                <p>MS 400 is formed from four manuscripts, the first three of which contain tracts by Gerald of Wales
                    (1146–1226). They contain an early thirteenth-century second edition of his <title>Topographia
                        Hiberniae</title> with additions from the third edition; a highly flawed sixteenth-century copy
                    of the <title>Descriptio Kambriae</title>; and early thirteenth-century copies of
                        <title>Retractationes</title>, <title>Catalogus brevior librorum suorum</title>, <title>De iure
                        et statu Meneuensis ecclesiae</title>, and <title>Verses</title>. The latter two texts in
                    particular are good versions. The final pages of the manuscript contain a late thirteenth-century
                    copy of the verses from the windows in the choir of Canterbury Cathedral which M. R. James
                    identified as the source for the copy on a roll held by the Dean and Chapter of Canterbury.</p>
