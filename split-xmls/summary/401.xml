                <p>CCCC MS 401 contains two texts in Arabic, Abd Allah Baydawi (d. A.H. 716), <title>Tawali' al-Anwar
                        min Matali' al-Anzar</title> and the commentary on it by Mahmud Isfahani (d. A.H. 749/50),
                        <title>Matali' al-Anzar, Sharh Tawali' al-Anwar</title>. It is one of a small handful of Arabic
                    manuscripts possessed by Parker. The greater part of the manuscript is in a sixteenth-century hand
                    but Parker wrote a note on the flyleaf indicating his belief that the codex had once belonged to
                    Theodore of Tarsus, archbishop of Canterbury (d. 690) and no doubt it was this misapprehension, as
                    much as Parker's interest in unusual scripts, that led him to acquire the volume. Parker's belief
                    that this manuscript was once in the possession of an early predecessor as archbishop may indicate
                    that the volume was acquired from a library in Canterbury, but beyond this, nothing is known of the
                    provenance of this manuscript.</p>
