            <div xml:id="CCC466" n="MS 466">
                <p>CCCC MS 466 is a twelfth-century collection of medical tracts assembled at St Augustine's,
                    Canterbury. Like many such medieval collections, what constitutes a 'medical' treatise is somewhat
                    elastic, this volume including as it does the verse discussion on the properties of stones by
                    Marbod, bishop of Rennes (1035-1123), the <title>Liber lapidum</title>, a copy of the
                        <title>Somniale Danielis</title>, a guide to the interpretation of dreams, as well as more
                    conventional material such as the treatise on the humours by Vindicianus (fl. late 4th century),
                        <title>Epistula ad Pentadium</title>. Something of the codicological history of this manuscript
                    can be inferred, as the flyleaves consist of a papal document from the time of Urban VI (1378-89)
                    and a note that the volume was 'reparacione fratris laurentii lenham'. Lenham has been identified as
                    a mid-fifteenth-century figure, suggesting that this volume was rebound twice in the medieval
                    period.</p>
