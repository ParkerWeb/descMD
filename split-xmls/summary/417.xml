                <p>CCCC MS 417 contains the unique copy of the <title>Chronicle</title> of Canterbury cathedral priory
                    by John Stone OSB (d. c. 1480), covering the years 1415 to 1467 with an anonymous continuation to
                    1472. The main text was probably written c. 1467-72. Appended to this is an account of the
                    enthronement of Archbishop William Wareham (c. 1456-1532) in 1503. Parker no doubt wanted to add
                    this manuscript to his collection because of its associations with the see of Canterbury and of a
                    previous incumbent as archbishop, both themes that are found throughout his collection. The
                    manuscript certainly came from Christ Church cathedral priory, Canterbury.</p>
