                <p>CCCC MS 419 is an important collection of Old English homilies, many by Wulfstan of York (d. 1023).
                    It was written in the first half of the eleventh century. Pp. 1-2 of <ref type="ms" target="CCC421"
                        >CCCC MS 421</ref> were originally physically part of this manuscript, and the original part of
                        <ref type="ms" target="CCC421">CCCC MS 421</ref> was a companion volume to CCCC MS 419, partly
                    written by the same scribe. The manuscripts were together at Exeter in the time of Bishop Leofric
                    (1050-1072), where additions were made to <ref type="ms" target="CCC421">CCCC MS 421</ref>. This
                    manuscript was Parker's seventh volume of homilies in his numeration system. He added a frontispiece
                    miniature of the Entry into Jerusalem taken from the same French thirteenth-century psalter as the
                    images which he added to <ref type="ms" target="CCC452">CCCC MS 452</ref> and London, Lambeth Palace
                    Library MS 1370 (The MacDurnan Gospels).</p>
