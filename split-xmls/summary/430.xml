            <div xml:id="CCC430" n="MS 430">
                <p>CCCC MS 430 contains three texts: Martin of Braga (c. 515-80), <title>Formula uitae honestae</title>,
                    which was often attributed to Seneca in the Middle Ages; Ferrandus (d. 546/7), deacon of Carthage,
                        <title>Ad Reginum comitem</title>, on Christian life for soldiers; and a sermon by Ambrosius
                    Autpertus (d. 784). It was written in the late ninth or very early tenth century at the abbey of
                    Saint-Amand in northern France, but was exported to England quite early, as is shown by
                    tenth-century additions it received probably at St Augustine's Abbey, Canterbury. It probably moved
                    again before the end of the middle ages, as it seems to be identifiable with a book seen at
                    Glastonbury Abbey by John Leland (1506-72), and may be mentioned in a Glastonbury inventory of 1247.
                    It constitutes interesting evidence for the transmission of texts from the Continent to England at
                    around the time of the Benedictine Reform Movement.</p>
