                <p>CCCC MS 246 is a small thirteenth-century Latin Bible with simple red and blue initials at the
                    beginning of each book. In France such portable Bibles were made in very large numbers in Paris
                    during the period c. 1220-80, but this one was made in England where relatively few were made. The
                    College copy of Stanley's Catalogue records CCCC MS 246 as a donation from John Duncombe. However,
                    as <ref type="ms" target="CCC245">CCCC MS 245</ref> is also listed as a donation from Duncombe,
                    James suggests that this manuscript might be the Bible donated by either William Roberts (Fellow in
                    1626) or T. Hopbury. William Roberts's donation was recorded in the Catalogue of Benefactors and T.
                    Hopbury's donation of a Bible was noted by Masters in his history of Corpus Christi College. The
                    book retains its original binding and is one of the best medieval bindings in the collection. As a
                    result of the fragility of this binding it has only been possible to image the exterior and interior
                    of the front cover, the exterior of the back cover, and part of the text pages, ff. 1r-22v.</p>
