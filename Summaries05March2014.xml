                <p>This manuscript is an English manuscript dating from c. 1425-50 containing tables on, and excerpts
                    from, the works of Gregory the Great. The manuscript also contains a copy of the <title>Liber
                        Gregorianus</title> of Garnerius of Saint-Victor OSA (d. 1170), and other works pertaining to
                    Gregory's writings. CCCC MS 1 is finely decorated with a large number of initials and borders in a
                    typical English style. James noted a similarity in appearance between this manuscript and <ref

                <p>This great Bible, CCCC MS 2, one of the most famous of the books in the Parker Library, is now bound
                    in three volumes (2I, 2II, 2III), although once was a single volume. 2I contains ff. 1r-121v with
                    Jerome’s Prologue and the books from Genesis to Joshua; 2II contains ff. 122r-241v with the books
                    from Judges to Isaiah; 2III contains ff. 242r-357v with the books from Jeremiah to Job. The single
                    volume thus contained the books of the Old Testament from Genesis to Job, and the second volume with
                    the remainder of the Bible has not survived. It can be identified with a Bible commissioned by
                    Hervey, the sacrist, for his brother, Talbot, prior of Bury St Edmunds Abbey, c. 1135-8, which was
                    illuminated by Master Hugo. The miniatures and some of the illuminated initials are painted on
                    separate pieces of vellum stuck to the page, and the description of the Bible in the <title>Gesta
                        Sacristarum</title> attests that master Hugo 'was unable to find any suitable calf-hide in these
                    parts' and had to purchase parchment from Ireland. Six large full-page or half-page miniatures
                    preface some of the books, whereas the others have historiated or ornamental initials. Six of the
                    large pictures have been removed from the book and are lost. It is a prime example of the very large
                    luxury Bibles made in the twelfth century for monastic houses. The artist, Master Hugo, was
                    influenced by Byzantine painting, and may have seen either illuminated manuscripts opr
                    wall-paintings, such as those of Asinou in Cyprus which most closely resemble his style. The faces
                    are modelled with shading in green and grey, and the folds are divided into sections reflecting the
                    position of the limbs. This has been called the 'damp-fold' style and influenced many other artists
                    working in England in the period c. 1140-70 at Canterbury, Winchester and elsewhere. After the
                    dissolution of the abbey of Bury St Edmunds at the Reformation the Bible eventually came into the
                    hands of Matthew Parker.</p>

            <div xml:id="CCC003" n="MS 3">
                <p>CCCC MSS 3-4 are a two-volume Bible made for Dover Priory, a dependency of Christ Church cathedral
                    priory, Canterbury. Like the Bury Bible, <ref type="ms" target="CCC002I">CCCC MS 2</ref>, it is of
                    very large size and typical of twelfth-century luxury monastic Bibles. This first volume contains
                    the Old Testament from Genesis to the Minor Prophets. There is no firm evidence for dating, although
                    a date c. 1150 is generally accepted. The script is close to the Eadwine Psalter (Cambridge, Trinity
                    College MS R.17.1) and dated charters produced at Canterbury in the 1150s. It seems fairly certain
                    that the mother house provided its dependency, Dover Priory, with the book, although at what date it
                    came to Dover is not known. It appears first in the 1389 catalogue of their books. There are
                    historiated or decorated initials at the beginning of the biblical books, illuminated by several
                    artists working in different styles. The artists of this first volume work in a Byzantinising style,
                    but different from that of Master Hugo in the Bury Bible, <ref type="ms" target="CCC002I">CCCC MS
                        2</ref>. Although it is also a version of the 'damp-fold' style, the folds are patterned in a
                    way closer to that of Byzantine artists. This artist of the Dover Bible may have travelled to Sicily
                    and was influenced by the style of mosaics such as those of the Cappella Palatina, Palermo.</p>
            </div>
            <div xml:id="CCC004" n="MS 4">
                <p>This second volume of the Dover Bible contains the latter part of the Old Testament from the Book of
                    Psalms, and the whole of the New Testament, and these books have historiated or ornamental initials.
                    The artists of this volume are different from the first volume, and their work is best parallelled
                    in North French or Flemish manuscripts of the second quarter of the twelfth century - it is possible
                    that they may indeed have come from the border region of France and Flanders, and this is suggested
                    by characteristic iconography from those parts. Some of their work shows Italo-Byzantine influence,
                    but quite different in appearance to that of the first volume, and characterised by patterned linear
                    folds in the form of 'nested V's'. Figures have large faces with staring eyes and heavy dark
                    eyebrows. The two volumes of the Bible found their way into Matthew Parker's collection after the
                    dissolution of the priory at the Reformation.</p>

                    writings of Marco Polo and the versified <title>Itinerarium Cambriae</title>. CCCC MS 5 was one of
                    several manuscripts (others include CCCC MSS <ref type="ms" target="CCC006">6</ref> and <ref

                    of St Albans in Hertfordshire. An inscription in this manuscript relates how Wintershill donated

                    his <title>Gesta abbatum Sancti Albani</title> copied from London, BL MS Cotton Claudius E. IV. In
                    addition, the manuscript contains a finely illustrated copy of Walsingham's <title>Liber

                    D. VII, and the <title>Annales Ricardi II et Henrici IV</title> attributed to William Wintershill.
                    Numerous illustrations represent the benefactors, a few as full figures but mostly as busts or
                    heads. The gatherings of the manuscript are in a confused condition, the volume having been found in
                    William Wintershill's cell in St Albans Abbey after his death (c. 1435) 'in quaternis derelictum'

                <p>The main text in CCCC MS 8, dating to the first half of the fourteenth century, is the encyclopaedia
                    of history, <title>Speculum historiale</title>, of the Dominican, Vincent of Beauvais
                    (1189/94-1264), which is also in CCCC MSS <ref type="ms" target="CCC013">13</ref>, <ref type="ms"

                    Municipale MS 568, dating to 1244, but omits the dedicatory letter and prologue. The back flyleaf of
                    the book, bound in at a later date, contains polyphonic music on a five-line stave, dating to the
                    middle years of the thirteenth century. The earliest English motet, 'Worldes blisce have god day,'
                    is on the recto, and an Anglo-Norman love song, 'Volez oyer le castoy', on the verso.</p>

                <p>MS 9 is one of two volumes which together constitute 'The Cotton–Corpus Legendary'; the other is
                    London, BL MS Cotton Nero E. I. CCCC MS 9 contains saints' lives pertaining to the months of
                    October, November and December, as well as a calendar which may once have been part of a separate
                    volume. The book is important because it is part of the earliest surviving multi-volume legendary
                    from England. An earlier version of the same legendary, compiled on the Continent, was in England by
                    the late tenth century, where it was extensively used by Ælfric in writing his Old English
                        <title>Lives of Saints</title>. It is therefore a very important witness to the knowledge of the
                    saints' lives in late Anglo-Saxon England, and has implications for our understanding of the
                    interactions between vernacular and Latin literature. The manuscript contains work by known
                    Worcester scribes, including one who wrote a charter for 1058. The calendar and computistical
                    material found at the start of MS 9 include a Easter tables for the years 1032-62 and 1063-94, and
                    the manuscript was probably therefore written before 1062. It contains later additions of a
                    hagiographical nature also made at Worcester.</p>

                    c. 1150). It is one of a group of finely illustrated manuscripts of the text produced in northern
                    France or southern England in the last quarter of the twelfth century. The various 'causae', the
                    legal cases, have historiated and ornamental initials. There is also a full-page miniature of a man
                    standing holding a consanguinity table. Its exact provenance and how it came to be in Parker's

                    text and thus of lesser interest; however, it is perhaps a useful witness to a renewed interest in
                    Carolingian scholarship in twelfth-century England.</p>

                        Care</title>, with the famous preface setting out Alfred the Great's educational policy. Alfred
                    arranged for translations to be made of the texts "most necessary for men to know", and this work by
                    Gregory was probably one of the earliest to be produced. The translation claims to be the work of
                    Alfred himself, although this has sometimes been challenged. MS 12 is one of only five manuscripts
                    (and a fragment) of this work surviving from Anglo-Saxon England, and probably dates from the tenth
                    century. It is not used in the standard edition by Sweet, who based his text on the two earliest
                    manuscripts. The manuscript was certainly at Worcester in the thirteenth century, when it was
                    annotated by the 'Worcester Tremulous Hand', whose glosses and marginal notes are found in several

                    attributed to John Chrysostom in this manuscript, but which was sometimes claimed for Augustine in
                    the Middle Ages. This sermon was included in Alain of Farfa's eighth-century Homiliary (Winter, item

                    his death in 1339. He kneels in the historiated initial at the beginning of the book. It
                    subsequently passed to Juliana de Leybourne, Countess of Huntingdon (d. 1367) who bequeathed it to
                    St Augustine's Abbey, Canterbury. With no less than 106 pictures, it is one of the finest

                    commentary text is in Anglo-Norman prose. It is closely related in both iconography and text to
                    another Anglo-Norman Apocalypse, Toulouse, Bibliothèque municipale MS 815, which is by a different
                    artist. Both manuscripts also contain the Vision of St Paul (the Journey of St Paul to Hell), in
                    Anglo-Norman verse, accompanied by illustrations. In addition, the Corpus manuscript contains the

                    coronation vestments, flanked by the bishops. The text mentions a Prince Edward, and may be a
                    version of that used for the coronation of Edward III in 1327. The style of the illustrations
                    suggests the 1330s.</p>

                    with a continuation to 1377, and was copied shortly after that date. A note in a fifteenth-century
                    hand records that the manuscript was given by 'Henry Somer' to the Hospital of St John the
                    Evangelist in Cambridge. It is sometimes assumed that this is the same man who is described as a
                    Fellow of King's Hall in the early fifteenth century. However, a case can be made for the donor to
                    have been another Henry Somer, a senior royal official who rose to be Chancellor of the Exchequer
                    (1410-39) before his death in 1450, and who expressed a desire to be buried at St John's Hospital.
                    The book passed into the possession of the newly founded St John's College in 1511, since another
                    scribble records the name of 'Shorton', presumably Robert Shorton, the first Master of St John's but
                    later Parker's predecessor as Dean of Stoke by Clare College (1529-35). A sixteenth-century note
                    adds that Somer was involved in a dispute with Corpus Christi over tithes due in Grantchester. It is
                    to be wondered how this '<title>Inimicus Collegio Corporis Christi Cantabrigiae</title>' might view

                    (c. 560-636), which is preceded by an index of its subject matter. The <title>Etymologiae</title> is
                    a compilation of universal knowledge in twenty books covering topics such as grammar, medicine,
                    theology and geography. Natural history is also extensively covered, and this is the subject of
                    another text in the book, a <title>Bestiary</title>, illustrated with coloured drawings of the
                    animals, birds, fish and reptiles. It is one of the oldest extant copies of an illustrated bestiary
                    made in England. The book also contains one text of a very different character, the
                        <title>Synonyma</title>, a devotional dialogue by Isidore of Seville between the sinful soul and
                    a personification of reason. Recent scholarship dates the book to c. 1150-70, but its place of
                    origin is uncertain, although possibly the North of England, perhaps Durham. There is no evidence of

                    works by Prudentius (fl. 384-410), most significantly his <title>Psychomachia</title>, a poem about
                    spiritual warfare between personifications of the vices and virtues. Many line drawings in coloured
                    ink illustrate events in the text. It was made in England probably in the late tenth century, and it
                    shares an artist with Bodleian Library MS Junius 11, the Junius manuscript of Old English poetry.
                    Art-historical evidence has tended to link the production of part one of CCCC MS 23 with Canterbury,
                    but a presentation inscription gives the manuscript provenance at Malmesbury, and it has also been
                    suggested that it could have been made there. In the eleventh century Old English captions were
                    added to the pictures. The second volume is a copy of Orosius, <title>Historia adversus
                        paganos</title> of 417-18, written by six scribes working at Dover in the second quarter of the

                    (c. 1300-49). The provenance of this volume is very well attested. An inscription states that the
                    book was given to the Benedictine cathedral priory of the Blessed Virgin Mary at Worcester by John
                    de Prestone of Somerset, a monk of the same institution, in 1348. The same notice also records
                    threats of divine punishment for anyone who erased the inscription or caused the book to be
                    alienated from the church ('quem titulum quicumque fraudulenter deleuerit librumque ab ecclesia
                    eadem alienauerit Deleat eum deus de libro uite et anathemate feriatur'). A second note states that

                    late fourteenth century from the North East Midlands. The volume, dating to c. 1400, was probably
                    composed as a Latin teaching aid and does not appear to be of Lollard derivation. The translation is
                    literal and the original author has added glosses to clarify the resultant awkward English. There

                    together by or for a secular figure with connections to London and Westminster. They include a
                    gazetteer of England, astrological and medical tracts, statutes and calendars of the term days of
                    the Exchequer and illustrated guides to the movement of the moon and tides. The London connection is
                    further evinced by the presence in the manuscript of unique accounts of some of the cases that came
                    before the eyre of 1321 that examined the liberties of the City. It may have been the property of
                    the Londoner John Reynham and passed from him, via a relative, to the Cistercian abbey at Boxley,

                    Dr Thomas Mankael after his death in c. 1329-31. Mankael was the first monk-student from St
                    Augustine's to graduate as a doctor of theology at Oxford. His personal collection of books,
                    presumably acquired during his time at Oxford in the 1320s, made up 39 entries in the St Augustine's
                    catalogue. CCCC MS 38 bears a donation inscription in which Mankael is named. A similar inscription

                        fortunae</title>. The text is concerned with the limitations of worldly success and pleasure,
                    and the problems of misfortune and adversity. A large part of this is in the form of a dialogue
                    between joy (<title>Gaudium</title>) and adversity (<title>Dolor</title>) with reason
                        (<title>Ratio</title>). It is given a Humanist emphasis by its supposed use of a classical model
                    - the <title>De remediis fortuitorum</title>, attributed in the Middle Ages to Seneca. There is no

                    is one of those made as part of Alfred the Great's campaign to translate into English "those books
                    most necessary for men to know". MS 41 was written in the first half of the eleventh century
                    probably somewhere in the south of England. It has a colophon asking for readers' blessings on the
                    unnamed scribe. The manuscript is large in format, written in grand round script, and was obviously
                    intended to be a high-grade book. Already in the eleventh century advantage was taken of its wide
                    margins to add a variety of marginalia, ranging from the Old English poem <title>Solomon and
                        Saturn</title> to liturgical texts and Old English charms. Probably at least some of these
                    additions were made at Exeter: MS 41 was one of the manuscripts given to Exeter Cathedral by Bishop
                    Leofric (1050-72), and still contains the bilingual donation inscription cursing anyone who removed
                    it thence. The decoration of the book consists of numerous ornated initials in brown outline and a

                    quarter of the twelfth century. Its provenance is given by the typical Dover arrangement of two
                    classmark- and contents-inscriptions, one on the opening page and one further on in the book; the
                    classmark matches these up to an entry in the Dover catalogue of 1389 which gives the opening words
                    of the page on which the second inscription occurs. We can be fairly certain that it was originally
                    written at Dover because the same hand also occurs in another Dover manuscript, <ref type="ms"
                        target="CCC462">CCCC MS 462</ref>. The manuscript contains hagiographical texts, starting with
                    the standard life of Martin of Tours, the epitome of a bishop saint. Two of the lives included are
                    of very important English saints, Edmund king and martyr and Dunstan, archbishop of Canterbury. It

                    sixteenth-century hands. Parker and his secretaries have added a number of aides mémoires to the
                    margins of the text, revealing their interest in the history of the English episcopacy. Some
                    fourteenth-century notes at the end of the manuscript, together with the script and ornament, led M.
                    R. James to believe that the manuscript had an East Anglian provenance, possibly from Norwich, but

                <p>This handsome manuscript contains a <title>Pontifical</title>. On script grounds it has been
                    attributed to Canterbury, probably St Augustine's rather than Christ Church; however its text has
                    been held to show that it was made for use at Christ Church, Canterbury. The script of CCCC MS 44
                    shows it to have been written at some point during the middle two quarters of the eleventh century,
                    but a more precise dating is arguably possible given the association of the coronation ordo it
                    contains (the third recension of the second ordo) with William the Conqueror. This association is by
                    no means generally accepted. The distinctive mark on f. 3 shows that the manuscript was at Ely in
                    the later Middle Ages. It has been suggested that it might have been part of the treasure of
                    Archbishop Stigand (1052-72), with which he fled to Ely shortly before his death in 1072; clearly
                    this again depends on how one interprets the dating evidence of the manuscript's text.</p>

                    inquisitor and scholar Bernard Gui OP (1261/2-1331) together with a handsomely illustrated
                    genealogical table of the Frankish kings. The second volume is a copy of the prose version of the
                        <title>Roman de Lancelot</title> that has been dated to c. 1250 and may have been produced in
                    England. How this manuscript came into Parker's possession is unknown, but it seems likely that he
                    was more interested in the illustrated historical material than in the Arthurian Lancelot story.</p>

                    sometimes described as the author's own copy that was presented by Salisbury to Archbishop Thomas
                    Becket. Whether this was the case or not, it was certainly at the Benedictine cathedral priory of
                    the Holy Trinity, Christ Church, Canterbury in the later twelfth century and remained there until it
                    came into Parker's possession. Nineteenth- and early twentieth-century editors and commentators
                    stressed the importance of the texts in this manuscript as early versions of John of Salisbury's
                    work. A more recent editor, however, has described the texts preserved in CCCC MS 46 as
                    'corrupt'.</p>

                    at the abbey during the abbacies of Abbot Simon (1167-83) and Abbot Warin (1183-95). Related in text
                    and decoration are two other St Albans Bibles of this period, Eton College MS 26 and Dublin, Trinity
                    College MS 51 (A.2.2). The main artist of the Corpus Bible also worked for the Abbey of St Bertin
                    and may be French in origin; he seems to have been a travelling illuminator. The book has thirteen
                    historiated initials some of them on separate pieces of vellum stuck onto the page. The version of
                    the Vulgate in this Bible has been classified by Glunz as 'Lanfranc's Scholastic Text'. The book is
                    much smaller than most twelfth-century Bibles, but is considerably larger than the small 'pocket'
                    versions which become popular in the middle years of the thirteenth century. An unusual feature of

                    Bibles are somewhat larger than contemporary Parisian Bibles, as in the case of this manuscript, and
                    relatively few were made in comparison with the very large numbers from Paris. Each book of the
                    Bible has an historiated initial. The manuscript belonged to St Augustine's abbey, and its
                    illumination is related to a Psalter (Oxford, Corpus Christi College MS 285) connected with Christ
                    Church, Canterbury. Another Bible (Oxford, Merton College MS 235) is also related in the style of
                    its illumination and was probably painted by the same artists. In view of the connections with St
                    Augustine's and Christ Church it is possible that the book was written and decorated in
                    Canterbury.</p>

                        <title>Glossa continua</title>, on the Pauline Epistles by Peter Lombard (c. 1095-1160). The
                    text is written in a fine hand, with attractive ornamental initials. The manuscript also contains
                    some passages from Augustine, <title>De trinitate</title> and Hilary, <title>De trinitate</title> in
                    a twelfth-century hand. The flyleaves contain fifteenth- or sixteenth-century recipes in Latin and

                <p>CCCC MS 53 contains three separate sections, a psalter, a chronicle of England and Peterborough
                    Abbey, and finally a bestiary. It is called the Peterborough Psalter and Bestiary because the
                    Psalter was adapted for the use of of that abbey, at which time the chronicle was added. The
                    Bestiary, which has been cut down to match the page size of the Psalter, was probably added to the
                    book at some later date. The dating of the Bestiary to c. 1300-10 is earlier by a decade or so than
                    that of the Psalter which is considered to be of c. 1310-20. Both are elaborately illuminated but by
                    quite different artists. The Psalter was originally intended for a patron in the diocese of Norwich
                    as evidenced by the original calendar to which Peterborough entries were added. The original patron,
                    perhaps Oliver de Wisset, was evidently connected with John de Warenne, Earl of Surrey (d. 1304),
                    whose obit is added in the original hand of the calendar. Perhaps during the production of the book
                    the patronage was taken over by Peterborough Abbey because the calendar was adapted to their use and
                    their Litany and Office of the Dead were added to the text, as was a chronicle of the abbey. It was
                    owned by the prior, Hugh de Stukeley, whose name is at the beginning of the book. The Psalter is
                    lavishly illustrated with twenty full page pictures of the Life of Christ, saints, prophets and
                    apostles preceding the Psalter text, some fully painted with gold grounds and others in coloured
                    drawing. The Psalter itself has historiated initials at the liturgical divisions, and many
                    decorative ornamental initials and borders. The artist of the fully painted pictures belongs to a
                    group of artists called the Queen Mary Psalter group after their main work, the Psalter, London, BL
                    MS Royal 2. B. VII. The Bestiary, by a different artist, who also worked on a psalter, Oxford, Jesus
                    College MS D.40, has 101 framed illustrations set in its text.</p>

                    Langton (c. 1150-1228) on parts of the Old Testament. Included are commentaries on the Pentateuch,
                    and the books from Joshua through to Maccabees. It has been noted that CCCC MS 55 contains
                    substantial textual differences to other copies of the same works. The marginal notes in this
                    manuscript are of particular interest in determining the relationship between Langton's commentaries
                    and his sermons, as they seems to show the excerpting of material from the commentaries for use in
                    preaching texts. CCCC MS 55 has been identified as the manuscript mentioned in a letter to Matthew
                    Parker from Aylmer, Archdeacon of Lincoln, thus suggesting that the manuscript was in Lincoln by the
                    mid-sixteenth century.</p>

                    with a continuation to 1273-4 which is attributed to William Rishanger. It is a direct copy of the
                    same text in Matthew's autograph copy, London, BL MS Royal 14. C. VII, a crude attempt even being
                    made to reproduce the heraldic shields found in the margins of this exemplar. The text of this
                    manuscript for the years 1253-74 was used as the basis for Parker's printed volume of the

                    version of Usuard's <title>Martyrologium</title> with Abingdon additions. It was written in Square
                    minuscule at the end of the tenth century or the start of the eleventh either at Canterbury, since
                    its texts are related to Canterbury manuscripts of similar material, or at Abingdon, where it has
                    certain early provenance. The additions to the Martyrology provide a large number of obits of people
                    connected with the monastery of Abingdon; unfortunately they have been badly damaged by a later
                    binder's trimming. In the eleventh century some damage to the manuscript was repaired by a scribe

                    theologian and archbishop of Canterbury (1207-1228). The manuscript is currently dated to the early
                    thirteenth century, and was therefore made during the lifetime of its author; the provenance is
                    unknown, but a scribal colophon locates the book to a certain 'Vallis Dei', a name common to
                    numerous religious houses in the Middle Ages. Langton's biblical commentaries have received little
                    scholarly attention compared to his sermon collections; hence CCCC MS 58 has been studied rather
                    less than other Parker Library manuscripts which contain sermons by Langton, such as <ref type="ms"

                    manuscript's profusion of texts and documents are the spurious <title>Letters</title> of Prester
                    John and of Alexander the Great to Aristotle, statutes, charters and papal bulls. There is a much
                    interest in chronological material, with short chronicles being accompanied by lists of popes,
                    emperors, kings and archbishops of Canterbury. The precise provenance of this manuscript is unknown,
                    though a continuation of one of the most substantial texts in the codex, <title>Chronica pontificum
                        et imperatorum</title> by Martin of Troppau OP (d. 1278), records the martyrdom of Thomas de la
                    Hale of Dover, suggesting a link to the south coast of England, possibly the Premonstratensian abbey

                    is also called Jean Boyvin in the description of a late fifteenth- or early sixteenth-century copy
                    of the same text now in the Bibliothèque Sainte-Geneviève in Paris (MS 516). The Corpus manuscript

                    Edward III from the French royal family, presumably part of the English propaganda campaign of the
                    Hundred Years' War. Parker gave a version of the <title>Memoriale</title> to Cambridge University
                    Library (now CUL MS Ii. 2. 18) and a copy was reportedly in the library of Sir Walter Cope (c.

                    after the poet's death in 1400. The poem was written at some time before 1385. This copy was planned
                    as a luxury edition to contain over ninety illustrations, but only the full-page frontispiece was
                    painted, with blank spaces left at the positions intended for the other pictures. In that
                    frontispiece Chaucer is shown reading his poem to the English court. The patron of this manuscript

                    costume in the centre of the courtly group. The book belonged in 1570 to the author, Stephen Batman,

                    Malmesbury OSB (c. 1080-1143), <title>Abbreviatio Amalarii</title>, an abbreviation of the work of

                <p>CCCC MS 69, containing Gregory the Great's Forty Homilies on the Gospels, was written in Insular
                    Hybrid minuscule and decorated in typical Insular fashion with red dots, interlace, and occasional
                    animal heads. It was probably made in England south of the Humber, dating to the early part of the
                    early ninth century, and is as such a relatively late product of the Insular book-producing
                    tradition in England, which was to be greatly disrupted by Viking attacks of the middle of the ninth
                    century. The text was used by Étaix in his edition of the work, although he denigrated it as
                    containing terrible readings and fantastic spellings; but its place of origin and early date seemed
                    to him too significant for the manuscript to be ignored.</p>

                <p>CCCC MS 70 contains a number of Anglo-Saxon, Norman and Plantagenet legal tracts, including the text
                    of the <title>Quadripartitus</title> and the <title>Leges Henrici Primi</title>. It was written by
                    or for Andrew Horn (c. 1275-1328) in the first quarter of the fourteenth century, probably to serve
                    as a private compilation of precedents able to inform any discussions of the customs of the City of
                    London. It is one of the manuscripts that Horn, a prominent City fishmonger and Chamberlain of
                    London (1320-28), bequeathed to the London Guildhall and was at one time almost certainly bound up
                    with the material that is now contained in <ref type="ms" target="CCC258">CCCC MS 258</ref>. This
                    provenance is neatly established by the presence within the manuscript of a drawing of a fish

                <p>As an important witness to the twelfth-century interest in texts of classical Roman and late antique
                    authors, CCCC MS 71 contains Macrobius, Saturnalia, Macrobius's commentary on Cicero's Somnium
                    Scipionis, and Apuleius, Opera philosophica. The Apuleius texts belong to the third group of
                    manuscripts of these works as classified by Beaujeu. The added thirteenth-century list of contents
                    on the flyleaf is in a special form characteristic of the Abbey of St Albans. It is likely that the
                    book was made at the abbey, although there is no firm evidence it was there until the thirteenth
                    century when the contents were listed. Thomson, in his study of St Albans manuscripts, dates the
                    book to c. 1150. On the flyleaf a fifteenth-century note values the book at xx s.</p>

                <p>Although arranged according to the texts of the four Gospels, rather than arranging the specific
                    readings according to the Sundays and feast days of the year, CCCC MS 72, was intended to serve as a
                    Gospel Lectionary for the readings at Mass. It begins with a table of the Gospel readings for the
                    church year, and in the margins are the names of the days on which the appropriate passages of text
                    are to be read. The Gospel text has been compared with Bibles produced at Canterbury and Glunz
                    classifies it as 'Lanfranc's Scholastic Text'. Although M. R. James thought that it might have been
                    made at St Albans, it is now thought more likely that it was made at Christ Church cathedral priory,
                    Canterbury. It has three very large and fine illuminated ornamental initials, and many smaller ones.
                    A dating of the book to the closing years of the twelfth century, perhaps c. 1180, seems likely.</p>

                    flyleaf of this manuscript is from an antiphoner and includes some music on a four-line stave. James

                    this manuscript from Norwich Cathedral Priory and it was one of three that the priory had been
                    bequeathed by their former owner, Cardinal Adam Easton (c. 1330-97), that Parker secured (see also
                    CCCC MSS <ref type="ms" target="CCC180">180</ref> and <ref type="ms" target="CCC347">347</ref>). It
                    was almost certainly once part of the Cardinal's reputedly extensive personal library. If so, it was
                    probably among the 228 books from that source which arrived in Norwich, packed in six barrels, in
                    1407, ten years after his death in Rome.</p>

                <p>This large glossed Psalter, CCCC MS 75, dating to c. 1220, contains the commentary of Peter Lombard
                    (c. 1095-1160) completed towards the end of his life in 1158/9. This was the most read of all
                    commentaries on the psalms in the later centuries of the Middle Ages. This is a luxury copy with
                    historiated initials placed at the liturgical divisions of the psalms, even though this book was
                    intended for scholarly rather than liturgical use. The iconography of these initials is
                    characteristic of the specifically English system used in the thirteenth century, although some of
                    them, like Noah's drunkenness for psalm 51, are rarely found. M. R. James suggested that the script
                    was characteristic of the abbey of St Albans, but the study by Thomson of St Albans books of this
                    period rejects it. It might have been made in East Anglia because it is illuminated by the same
                    artists as the Psalter, London, BL MS Lansdowne 431, which was made for an Augustinian house in that

                    c. 1199/1200) under the title <title>Annales de Dorobernensibus Archiepiscopis</title>. The

                    be that of Diceto himself. An inscription hints that this manuscript may have been intended for
                    presentation to Hubert Walter, archbishop of Canterbury (d. 1205). If so, this may explain how it
                    came to be in the possession of a later archbishop, Stephen Langton (c. 1165-1228) from whom it
                    passed to the priory of the Holy Trinity, Christ Church, Canterbury where it is recorded in the

                    77 was written in the fourteenth century and an inscription establishes that it was once at the

                <p>CCCC MS 79, dating from c. 1400 and c. 1410, is the most elaborate decorated Pontifical to survive
                    from medieval England. The text contains the church services particular to bishops, and is a
                    specifically English version rather than the Durandus edition of the Pontifical widely used
                    throughout Europe at this time. Its ownership can be determined from the heraldry on some of its
                    pages, and it seems to have passed through the hands of three bishops who made additions to the text
                    and illumination. The original patron of the book seems to have been Guy de Mohun, bishop of St
                    Davids (1397-1407), and it then passes first to Richard Clifford, bishop of Worcester (1401-1407)
                    and bishop of London (1407-1421) who had further illumination done, and finally to Philip Morgan,
                    bishop of Worcester (1419-1426) and bishop of Ely (1426-1435) who added a section of text. By 1489
                    the Pontifical was at St Paul's Cathedral because on ff. 1v-2 are added the texts for the ceremony
                    held there in that year of the presentation of the papal sword and cap to Henry VII by Pope Innocent
                    VIII's nuncio. Small framed miniatures and historiated initials illustrate the various pontifical
                    offices, and many pages have elaborate gilded borders and ornamental initials. The book was probably
                    made in London because its artists in their ornament and figure style derive from the illuminators
                    who made the Litlyngton Missal (Westminster Abbey MS 37) in 1383-1384.</p>

                    texts, translated and versified from the French prose version. Lovelich was a member of the
                    Skinners' Company of London, and it seems likely that, until it came into Parker's possession, this
                    manuscript had remained in or around London. Certainly it contains a number of notes added in the
                    later fifteenth century in the hand of John Cok, a priest at the Augustinian hospital of St

                    some of the scholia on <title>Odyssey</title> yield new textual evidence. A circular cartouche on
                    p.1 with the name 'Theodoros' in gold letters is probably a sign of Theodore Gaza's (c.1400-1475)

                <p>CCCC MS 88 contains the Commentary on Matthew of Claudius Taurinensis, bishop of Turin (d. c. 827).
                    This work has not been edited, with the exception of the epistolary preface, and some of the early
                    sections which were examined in McMenomy's unpublished Ph.D. dissertation. Claudius wrote this text
                    in the early ninth century; his iconoclastic views led to his often being attacked as a heretic,
                    although he was never officially condemned. This manuscript has split scholarly opinion over its
                    origin: the most usually accepted view is that it was written on the Continent in the tenth century;
                    however it has also been suggested that it was written in England either circa 1000 or in the first
                    half of the eleventh century. It contains a flyleaf from a fifteenth-century service-book. CCCC MS
                    88 may possibly be identifiable with a manuscript seen by John Leland (d. 1552) at Sherborne Abbey
                    in the 1530s. It seems to have later belonged to the historian John Bale (1495-1563), for whom
                    Parker found work at Canterbury in his declining years.</p>

                    of manuscripts of Langton's works described by Lacombe and Smalley as 'collections without order'.
                    As with <ref type="ms" target="CCC031">CCCC MS 31</ref>, this collection of Langton's commentaries

                    in the Parker Library to retain its original binding, a fine and well-preserved example. As a result

                    of Thomas Netter's refutation of Lollard teachings. Netter was, himself, a Carmelite friar who
                    served as the prior provincial of the Carmelite order in England, as confessor to both Henry V and
                    Henry VI of England, and as Henry V's envoy to King W?adis?aw of Poland and Michael Küchmeister,

                    Bibliothèque Royale MS 10238). <title>Histoire</title> was probably composed in Flanders in the
                    1450s, and the Corpus version is illustrated c. 1470-80 with a large frontispiece miniature by an
                    anonymous Flemish artist who is known to have worked on a number of other volumes for patrons with
                    connections to Edward IV. The artist has been named the Master of the Harley Froissart. This has led
                    to speculation that this manuscript may have been produced for Edward IV or possibly William, Lord
                    Hastings, c. 1475. Whoever the patron was, he was a Knight of the Garter, as evidenced by the garter
                    surrounding the now erased blank shield on f. 1r. How the codex came into Parker's possession is

                    of Marianus Scotus and Eadmer of Canterbury as the basis for his work, John compiled the
                        <title>Chronica</title>, adding numerous details of English history. This manuscript of the text
                    was produced at Abingdon Abbey in the third quarter of the twelfth century, but was later at
                    Peterborough Abbey, from where it presumably passed into Parker's collection.</p>

                    directions for the church services for the Mass and the Divine Office. The liturgical use of Exeter
                    was an adaptation for that diocese of the Use of Sarum which from the mid-thirteenth century onwards
                    spread over most parts of England. The book also contains a Martyrology of Exeter which compares
                    with that of Exeter, Cathedral Library MS 3518. These copies of the Ordinal reveal the extent of
                    difference from Sarum. MS 93 has fine illuminated borders with the monogram WS at the main divisions

                    law codes known as the <title>Quadripartitus</title>. The version of the

                        Chronicle</title>, since the arms of William, 4th lord Fitzhugh (1425-1452), depicted in a
                    gilded initial, probably identify him as the first owner. Thereafter it was in the hands of John

                    genealogy from Adam to Henry V. On the basis of its decoration and style, the roll has been dated to
                    c, 1470, a conclusion supported by the slightly defensive description of Edward IV (who had been
                    deposed and regained the throne in 1470-71) as 'dei gratia uerus et indubitatus Rex'. It is not

                    on the roll. A dating has been suggested as c. 1475-1500. It is not clear whether this roll was ever
                    in Parker's possession, although it would be consistent with his interest in all aspects of British
                    history. A note in the hand of Matthew Parker's son, John, however, records what may be this roll at

                    collection of alchemical treatises copied in the late fourteenth century. The presence of a number
                    of rough sketches of alchemical instruments and the profusion of stains that litter the manuscript

                    of Parker's career and interests. There are numerous documents and accounts relating to the uneasy
                    relations between England and Scotland at the start of Elizabeth's reign, a result of Parker's
                    involvement with Elizabeth's rule. There is also an Anglo-Saxon wordlist, a reflection of Parker's
                    interest in the church in Anglo-Saxon England. The volume also includes accounts of the coronation
                    of king Edward VI, the baptism of Elizabeth I and excerpts from the Croyland continuation of Peter
                    of Blois regarding the foundation of the University of Cambridge. The manuscript dates to the third
                    quarter of the sixteenth century.</p>

                <p>MS 106 contains a large collection of letters, documents and transcripts relating to the
                    administration of the University of Cambridge and the university's relationship with the town of
                    Cambridge. For the most part, this material relates to the sixteenth century but there are a few

                <p>CCCC MS 107 is a miscellany written c. 1500, but containing one thirteenth-century quire (ff. 169-76)
                    bound in at the end. The texts contained in the volume are diverse with no apparent thematic unity.
                    Among them are Seneca's tragedies, <title>Hercules furens</title>, <title>Thyestes</title> and
                        <title>Octavia</title>, François de Meyronnes OFM (d. after 1328), <title>De
                        indulgentiis</title> and other works, an extract from Walter Map (c. 1140-1210), <title>De nugis
                        curialium</title>, extracts from Petrus Riga (d. 1209), <title>Aurora</title> (this is in the
                    thirteenth-century section) and John Duns Scotus OFM (d. 1308), <title>De perfectione
                        statuum</title>. The reason why the commissioner of the manuscript wanted such an unusual
                    collection of texts is a mystery. The annotations by Matthew Parker in various parts of the book
                    suggest that the thirteenth-century part was bound together with the c. 1500 part when the
                    manuscripts came into his collection.</p>

                <p>MS 108, contains a large collection of documents and letters collected by Matthew Parker (1504-1575).
                    His diverse career included serving as the dean of Stoke by Clare College; as one of Anne Boleyn's
                    chaplains and, after her fall, as one of the king's chaplains; as dean of Lincoln and prebend of
                    Corringham in Lincoln Cathedral, as master of Corpus Christi College and Vice-Chancellor of the
                    University of Cambridge; and as archbishop of Canterbury. Just as this broad career is reflected
                    across the Parker Library collection as a whole, much of it is reflected here in a microcosm of
                    letters and documents relating to Stoke by Clare College, Lincoln cathedral, Cambridge and the
                    government of England. This manuscript also contains a copy of the 'Report on the conditions of
                    Cambridge' which Parker and others compiled when the Chantries Act of December 1545 threatened the
                    University of Cambridge's financial security. The manuscript dates to the sixteenth century.</p>

            <div xml:id="CCC109" n="MS 109">
                <p>Matthew Parker's manuscript collection naturally reflects his interest in Reformation theology and
                    theologians and the religious debates which took place in the sixteenth century. MS 109 is one of
                    the compilations of tracts and letters Parker assembled from his collection. The volume consists of
                    letters written to Matthew Parker and tracts on issues such as clerical marriage, the sacraments and
                    monastic vows. The volume also contains a copy of 'Against the opinions of the Germans' by Henry
                    VIII. The manuscript dates to the sixteenth century.</p>

                    turn, Bodleian MS Jones 4 contains transcripts from this manuscript. There is some emphasis on
                    Winchester in the transcribed documents, but much of the material relates to English history in
                    general. There is also a Reformation tract, 'A discourse proving that priests may lawfully marry',
                    near the end of the volume. The manuscript dates to the sixteenth century.</p>

                <p>This large composite volume contains much important documentary material from Anglo-Saxon England, in
                    both medieval and antiquarian copies. Pp. 1-132 relate to Bath Abbey; some of this material was
                    previously bound with <ref type="ms" target="CCC140">CCCC MS 140</ref>, the Bath Old English Gospel
                    Book. This section starts with an Old English relic-list of Bath and some Old English manumissions,
                    which were written into <ref type="ms" target="CCC140">CCCC MS 140</ref> to emphasise their legal
                    and religious importance. These are followed by a short twelfth-century gospel lectionary. There is
                    also the unique manuscript of the pilgrimage of Sæwulf to Jerusalem in 1102-1103, and an important
                    post-Conquest Old English confraternity agreement between various western religious houses,
                    predominantly Chertsey, Bath, Pershore, Evesham, Winchcombe, Gloucester and Worcester, with the
                    names of some of the monks. On p. 57 starts the Bath Cartulary proper, an important twelfth-century
                    record of Bath Abbey's archives. This contains a large number of Anglo-Saxon charters, which have
                    recently been definitively edited by Susan Kelly, and more charters from the post-Conquest period
                    into the reign of Henry II. It also contains an important Domesday satellite survey, probably part
                    of the material drawn up to be used in the creation of Domesday Book proper. Pp. 139-78 constitute a
                    very important set of transcripts by Robert Talbot (c. 1505-1558) predominantly of original
                    Anglo-Saxon charters from the archives of Abingdon Abbey in the possession of Dr George Owen (d.
                    1558). These documents have since been lost making this the only witness to their text. This
                    collection was acquired early by Parker, who added some material. Pp. 187-317, which have their own
                    pagination showing that they were once a separate volume, contain another collection of
                    sixteenth-century antiquarian transcripts of medieval charters. This compilation is descended from
                    the 'Prise-Say' collection of monastic foundation charters, made by William Say at the request of
                    Sir John Prise in 1535, during the dissolution of the monasteries. This section of CCCC MS 111
                    starts with accounts of the foundations of monastic houses with a note saying it was compiled by the
                    antiquary John Stow (c. 1525-1605) in September 1566, clearly using the Prise-Say register. There
                    are also copies of charters from the Prise-Say collection (which survives in a manuscript at
                    Winchester Cathedral) and miscellaneous supplementary material from a different but related source.
                    The manuscript concludes with material largely relating to the dissolution of the monasteries.</p>

                    to many of his contemporaries. The codex, written in the second half of the fifteenth century,
                    contains a number of texts attributed to Ramón Lull (1232?-1315), though in practice many of these
                    cannot be shown to have been written by him. It is illustrated by large drawings greater and smaller
                    than half-page of alchemical instruments and furnaces. Similar but much smaller drawings occur in
                    some margins. It is not known how this manuscript came to be in Parker's collection. </p>

                    Melanchthon (1497-1560) and the other half consists mainly of tracts written by such men. Topics

                    Originally written c. 1469-1470, the membrane side contains a genealogy of the English kings from

                    Bucer's amanuensis, who also added a dedication to Matthew Parker. Martin Bucer (1491-1551) was a
                    German Reformation theologian who moved to England in 1549 as a result of Archbishop Cranmer's
                    invitation and Bucer's refusal to accept the Augsburg Interim (the temporary agreement brokered
                    between the Catholics and Protestants at the Diet of Augsburg in 1548). Hermann von Wied was
                    Archbishop of Cologne from 1515 to 1546. Initially hostile to Luther and the reformers, he
                    eventually became sympathetic to the reformers' cause and was forced to resign his
                    archbishopric.</p>

                    completed some time after 1363, where the account ends. The work is a uniquely valuable source for
                    the history of the troubled Anglo-Scottish border region and wider English politics of the
                    mid-fourteenth century. The unique copy in this manuscript, probably dating to c. 1400, was made not
                    long after the date of the original text's completion and, since the early fifteenth century, has
                    been bound with a late fourteenth-century copy of the <title>Algorism</title>, a verse and prose
                    treatise on mathematics in Anglo-Norman and English. The manuscript was almost certainly in the
                    hands of Gerald FitzGerard, Earl of Kildare (d. 1534) and may have come to that family from a
                    descendant of the work's original author. It was subsequently acquired by the historian John Bale
                    (1495-1563), during his brief tenure as bishop of Ossory in 1552, and probably came to Parker from

                    are used in most of the English illustrated Apocalypses. This book is from the Benedictine Abbey of
                    Peterborough and can probably be identified in a list of books intended for reading in the
                    refectory. On the basis of comparison of its script with other Peterborough manuscripts the dating
                    of the book is c. 1125-1150. Berengaudus is a man of whom very little is known of his dates or where
                    he was writing. The main controversy is whether he can be identified with Berengaudus of Ferrières
                    who lived in the second half of the ninth century or another Berengaudus writing in the second half
                    of the eleventh century.</p>

                    has certain provenance at Bury St Edmunds. It has been suggested that it was made for the younger
                    Anselm at Canterbury, but a Bury origin seems more likely since it shares a scribe with several
                    manuscripts from Bury, including Cambridge, Trinity College, MS R. 7. 28 (scribe 2). It seems to

                    Lateran council of 1215. They were intended for the use of parish priests and confessors. Among the
                    texts it contains are: Raymond of Peñafort OP (c. 1190-1275), <title>Summa de casibus

                    Christ Church, Canterbury, and might be identifiable with a book transferred to Evesham Abbey in the
                    late fourteenth century. The last item, the homily of Origen on the lament of Mary Magdalene at the

                    in the second half of the eleventh century at Bath Abbey in Somerset. Each of the gospels was
                    written by a different scribe in codicologically separate sections, but this was probably for speed
                    of production rather than because the gospels were originally kept separately. The scribe of Matthew
                    ended with a colophon naming himself as one Ælfric, and stating that he wrote at Bath for the
                    benefit of a certain Brihtwold. The manuscript attracted early additions, especially of documents,
                    in the manner typical of Latin gospel books, suggesting that its language gave it no lower status.
                    These include many manumissions of slaves and an agreement between the prior of Bath and some
                    townspeople. Some of MS 140 was moved by Parker into <ref type="ms" target="CCC111">CCCC MS

                    it in 1337/38 while a member of the household of John Grandisson, bishop of Exeter. The text has
                    been edited and extensively discussed by Haren. Paradoxically, although intended as a text for
                    parish priests, this copy has a press mark suggesting its ownership by the Benedictine monks of
                    Norwich Cathedral Priory. The suggested dating of the book is c. 1350.</p>

                    (c. 1258-c. 1334), a legal text by the canon lawyer, Iacobus de Theramo (Giacomo Palladini) (c.

                    century continental religious humanists, including Robert Gaguin OTrin (d. 1501), Johannes

                    himself a former Carmelite, put the two distinct volumes together before it passed, along with other

                    style in the British Isles - and thus attests to contacts between Francia and Wales in the ninth and

                    John Cassian (c. 360-430/35). The other three sections date variously to c. 1400-1450 and c.
                    1425-1475. Several of the texts are Franciscan and Dominican and perhaps these three sections were
                    compiled for the use of mendicants. They include works on indulgences and confession by François de
                    Meyronnes OFM, Richard FitzRalph (d. 1360) and Richard of Saint-Victor OSA (d. 1173), and letters

                    the Council of Basel (1431-1449). This council attempted to assert the superiority of church
                    councils to the pope and declared Eugene IV (1383-1447, pope 1431-1447) deposed in 1440. They then
                    elected the antipope Felix V, resulting in a schism that lasted until Felix V submitted to Eugene

                <p>The text and script of CCCC MS 158, dating to c. 1450-1475, are a very good example of the sort of
                    manuscript made for English humanists of the middle years of the fifteenth century. It is a copy of
                    two works of Cicero on rhetoric. It was written in Italian-influenced humanist script by the scribe,
                    John Pacy, who also worked on Cambridge, Pembroke MS 235, which is dated 1464. M. R. James thought
                    that it came from the cathedral priory of Christ Church, Canterbury, but it does not appear to be
                    listed in the catalogue. Matthew Parker, misled by the Roman form of the script, notes on f. 1 that
                    the book belonged to Theodore, the seventh-century archbishop of Canterbury. The book contains fine
                    decorative initials containing grotesques and dragons in grisaille.</p>

                    Forty Homilies on the Gospels, but is not significant in the textual tradition. It contains a
                    medieval price mark of thirteen shillings and four pence. It is one of the few surviving Corpus
                    manuscripts which was already in the college's collection when the Parker manuscripts arrived, as it
                    has been identified as one of the items in Thomas Markaunt's bequest of 1439, there valued at
                    fourteen shillings. Markaunt was a fellow of the college and left it 76 volumes, with detailed
                    instructions for their use including complex arrangements for lending them out among the Master and
                    Fellows. However, many of these books had been lost by the middle of the sixteenth century, and
                    others were absorbed into the Parkerian collection. James suggested that MS 159 originally came from
                    Norwich, but subsequent scholarship has shown that its classmark "B 53" is not in the right format;
                    Norwich classmarks used a lower-case Roman number after the letter.</p>

                    identified as the possible place of origin, and it seems that the manuscript was later at
                    Canterbury. The majority of the Lives in the collection are of English or British saints, including
                    Aldhelm, David, Dunstan, Ithamar, Neot, and Swithun, but four Cluniac saints are also included,
                    which supports the connection with Faversham. Faversham is in the diocese of Rochester whose
                    cathedral contained the relics of the rarely mentioned Ithamar. According to Lapidge, many of the
                    vitae are somewhat abbreviated. The frontispiece depicts a bishop, and it has been suggested that
                    this may be St Dunstan.</p>

                    340 and 342 and London, BL MS Royal 6. C. I, suggest that it originated somewhere in the south-east
                    of England, perhaps at Rochester or Canterbury. The texts it contains are mostly by Ælfric, but it
                    also includes some anonymous material, including sermons for Thursday, Friday and Saturday of Holy
                    Week, for which Ælfric refused to provide sermon material. Parker removed some material from <ref

                <p>CCCC MS 163 contains a Pontifical of the Romano-Germanic type. It was written in the second half of
                    the eleventh century, probably at Worcester, although the Old Minster and the Nunnaminster at
                    Winchester have both also been suggested. In text it is closely related to London, BL MS Cotton
                    Vitellius E. XII, and may even have been directly copied from it. The Romano-Germanic Pontifical
                    originated in Germany in the tenth century and spread rapidly because it brought together a
                    comprehensive set of texts for performing the duties of a bishop. These two English copies seem to
                    descend from a Cologne manuscript, and it has been suggested that the line of transmission was
                    Bishop Ealdred's visit to Cologne in 1054. Ealdred, bishop of Worcester and later archbishop of
                    Canterbury, was sent by Edward the Confessor on a diplomatic mission to Henry III, probably leading
                    to the return to England of Edward the Exile in 1057, and it seems likely that he acquired a text of
                    the Romano-Germanic pontifical on this occasion. MS 163 contains four ordines for the consecration
                    of women while omitting all those for abbots and monks, and may therefore have some connection with
                    a nunnery.</p>

                    Calahorra, was the governor of Castel Sant'Angelo. It is not known how such a book came to England.
                    In the sixteenth century it was owned by Thomas Godsalve, notary public of Norwich, and in 1567 by
                    Peter Hobard of Dennington. The book is decorated with one large initial in gold with white branch
                    work, and a few smaller initials of the same type.</p>

                    (1393-1464). The <title>Abreviacion</title> was completed c. 1462-3 and was, in some senses, an
                    anachronism; the supra-national chronicle or 'world history' having been supplanted by works
                    concentrating on national history. Capgrave's major sources were the <title>Chronicon pontificum et
                        imperatorum</title> of Martin of Troppau (d. 1278) and a lost version of the St Albans chronicle
                    of Thomas of Walsingham OSB (d. 1422). The text in the Corpus manuscript, produced c. 1500, was once
                    thought to have been a copy of the autograph version of the material in Cambridge UL MS Gg.4.12, but
                    it is now thought instead to derive from a lost author's working copy of the
                        <title>Abreviacion</title>. It is not known how this codex came to be in Parker's

                <p> MS 172 contains two works. The first is Martin Bucer's critique of the 1549 Book of Common Prayer.
                    Martin Bucer (1491-1551) was a reformation theologian from Alsace and a prominent figure in the
                    English reformation, becoming Regius Professor of Divinity at the University of Cambridge late in
                    1549. MS 172 also contains a discussion of predestination by John Skip (d. 1552), who served as
                    Queen Anne Boleyn's almoner and as the bishop of Hereford.</p>
            </div>
            <div xml:id="CCC173" n="MS 173">
                <p>In CCCC MS 173 is found the Parker Chronicle, one of the most important manuscripts for our
                    understanding of Anglo-Saxon history. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, the earliest history written in
                    English, seems to have originated under the impetus of Alfred the Great's educational reforms, and a
                    core set of annals was composed which were then augmented variously over the years in different
                    places. Every version of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle is therefore different and has its own
                    complicated transmission history. The Parker Chronicle, also known as the A-version, is the oldest
                    manuscript surviving. It was started in the late ninth century and continued into the eleventh. It
                    originated somewhere in Wessex, probably Winchester where it has mid tenth-century provenance, but
                    had moved to the cathedral priory of Christ Church, Canterbury by the end of the eleventh century.
                    Although the Chronicle is the most famous part of the manuscript, it also contains other very
                    important material. In the same section as the Chronicle there are important early texts of the Old
                    English laws of Alfred the Great and the late seventh-century laws of his distant predecessor on the
                    throne of Wessex, King Ine (d. in or after 726), as well as a list of bishops and popes. A second
                    volume was already bound with the Chronicle manuscript in the Middle Ages: this contains works by
                    the late Antique poet Sedulius (fl. first half of the fifth century), in particular his
                        <title>Carmen paschale</title>, a retelling of the gospels in bombastic Virgilian Latin verse.
                    This part of the manuscript is older than the Chronicle, probably dating to the third quarter of the
                    eighth century, and is an important witness to English scholarship before the disruption caused in
                    the ninth century by Viking attacks. It seems to have the name of Frithestan, bishop of Winchester
                    909-31, on f. 57r. The volume was greatly valued by Parker and his circle; Parker brought the list
                    of archbishops of Canterbury up to date to include own name. It was also used in the earliest
                    printed book in Old English, Parker's <title>Testimonie of Antiquitie</title>.</p>

                <p>CCCC MS 174, dating to c. 1420, contains a version of the Middle English prose Brut chronicle
                    sometimes defined as the 'Common Version' to 1377. As such it represents another manuscript that
                    demonstrates Parker's interest in British history, attested by a note in his own hand referring to a
                    similar text in <ref type="ms" target="CCC182">CCCC MS 182</ref>. Another sixteenth-century hand has
                    added a note to the effect that this text served as the model for William Caxton's <title>Fructus
                        temporum</title>. The version of the text as preserved in this manuscript was used as the basis
                    for the edition of the Brut for the years 1333 to 1377 edited by F. W. D. Brie in 1908. Its
                    provenance is unknown.</p>

            <div xml:id="CCC175" n="MS 175">
                <p>CCCC MS 175 contains a copy of an historical compilation called the Memoriale commonly attributed to
                    Walter of Coventry who was writing in the second half of the thirteenth century, the period in which
                    this manuscript of his text was written. In addition, the first few leaves of the manuscript are
                    taken up with a range of historical notes, extracts and genealogical tables, some relating to the
                    archdiocese of York. The manuscript was almost certainly in the hands of the Tudor poet and
                    antiquary John Leland (1506-1552), who thought it was in poor condition - '<title>Codex erat aliquot
                        locis mancus</title>'. The historian John Bale (1495-1563) saw the manuscript in Leland's
                    collection, but Parker must have acquired it some time before 1572 (possibly from the Cheapside
                    resident William Carye), since the text was used as the basis for the archbishop's
                        <title>Antiquitates</title> published in that year. The manuscript was copied many time in the
                    course of the sixteenth, seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the details it supplied about church
                    government in Angevin England being keenly studied by church historians.</p>

                <p>CCCC "MS" 176 consists of three printed books bound together and, although the policy of the Parker
                    on the Web project was not to image printed material, an exception was made in this instance because
                    of the particular interest of the first and last items. All three parts were printed in 1574 and
                    were edited by (or under the auspices of) Archbishop Matthew Parker from his own manuscript
                    collections. Two were printed by the famous evangelical printer John Day (d. 1584), who produced
                    Parker's most important publications, and one by John Bynneman (d. 1583), who was also patronised by
                    Parker. Part A is Parker's important <hi rend="italic">editio princeps</hi> of Asser's <title>Life
                        of Alfred</title>, containing parallel Latin and Old English material, printed in a special
                    Insular typeface. Because the only medieval manuscript of this work was completely destroyed in the
                    Cottonian fire of 1731, modern editions have had to depend on transcripts and the early printed
                    editions, most of which descend in some way from Parker's work. Parker interpolated Asser's life
                    with material from the Annals of St Neots, and thus popularised the famous story of Alfred burning
                    the cakes while hiding in the Somerset marshes. This book was an important part of the early modern
                    cult of Alfred the Great. Parts B and C are Thomas of Walsingham's <title>Historia breuis</title>,
                    and the <title>Ypodigma Neustriae</title> also often attributed to him. The latter is taken from the
                    unique surviving copy in <ref type="ms" target="CCC240">CCCC MS 240</ref>, which cannot be
                    completely digitised due to the delicate state of its early modern binding. It consists of a
                    chronicle of events in Normandy and England from 911 AD to 1416 AD and written, perhaps, as a
                    flattery to Henry V's successful conquests in France. This book is mentioned in the Parker register
                    and came to Corpus with the majority of Parker's collection. The three sections are also found bound
                    together in the Cambridge University Library copy, in the three British Library copies, and in
                    another which came into the possession of Corpus in the nineteenth century, suggesting that Parker
                    had the three texts circulated together. </p>

                    honestae</title>, now commonly attributed to Martin of Braga (c. 515-80), a group of Aesop's

                    on the <title>Epistola</title> by John Ridewall OFM (d. after 1340). It has been conjectured that

                    have passed to Parker, but this is not certainly established.</p>

            <div xml:id="CCC178" n="MS 178">
                <p>CCCC MS 178 consists of two Anglo-Saxon manuscripts bound together. The first is a collection of Old
                    English homilies, mostly by Ælfric OSB (d. c. 1010) but with some anonymous and composite material.
                    It was written in the first half of the eleventh century, probably towards the end of that period. A
                    colophon lays out the compiler's intentions: twelve sermons are given which may be preached at any
                    time, and another twelve for specific occasions; twenty-two of these are taken exactly from an
                    exemplar but two have been augmented; the sermons for specific days are by Ælfric. This colophon
                    seems more or less accurate when compared to the manuscript as it survives. It was at Worcester by
                    the end of the eleventh century, when it was annotated by the scribe Coleman, probably the chaplain
                    of Wulfstan, bishop of Worcester (d. 1095). Parker removed some leaves of this part of MS 178 into
                        <ref type="ms" target="CCC162">CCCC MS 162</ref>. The second Anglo-Saxon manuscript is a copy of
                    the bilingual Benedictine Rule, with each chapter in Latin followed by its translation into Old
                    English. It contains some feminine forms but seems to represent a stage in the transmission of the
                    text where it was being changed from nuns' to monks' use. It was written in the first half of the
                    eleventh century. It was certainly at Worcester, and probably already associated with the homily
                    manuscript, in the thirteenth century when both were annotated by the famous 'Worcester Tremulous
                    Hand'.</p>

                    the papal curia, becoming a cardinal in 1381. The book later belonged to Norwich Cathedral Priory
                    where Easton had become a monk c. 1350, although he spent most of his life away from the priory at
                    Oxford University, Avignon and Rome. This book might have been made in Oxford before Adam departed

                    handsome decorative initials. As one of several chronicles of English history in the collection,
                    this volume in particular reveals Parker's efforts to collate the information provided by his other
                    sources. Notes in Parker's hand in this manuscript reveal that he compared the text of the

            <div xml:id="CCC183" n="MS 183">
                <p>CCCC MS 183 is one of several manuscripts associated with Æthelstan, King of the English (924/5-39),
                    but the only one of these written in England in his reign. He seems to have commissioned it for
                    presentation to the community of St Cuthbert, which at this point was at Chester-le-Street in
                    Country Durham, having fled Lindisfarne to escape Viking attacks but not yet settled in its eventual
                    home at Durham. The famous presentation picture shows Æthelstan, with bowed head, presenting the
                    book to St Cuthbert himself, and is a very important example of the revival of figure art in
                    manuscript painting during Æthelstan's reign. It was written between 934 and 939, the year of
                    Æthelstan's death, by a scribe who also appears in London, BL MS Royal 7. D. XXIV, perhaps at
                    Glastonbury, but certainly somewhere in the south of England. It contains Bede's two Lives of St
                    Cuthbert, the first in prose and the second metrical, and a mass and office for Cuthbert's feast
                    day, as well as lists of popes, bishops, and kings, and a record of Æthelstan's other gifts to the
                    community. Its production can be linked to Æthelstan's political activities in the North.</p>

                <p>CCCC MS 184 contains a twelfth-century copy of Eusebius of Caesarea (c. 260-c. 340) <title>Historia
                        ecclesiastica</title> in the Latin translation by Rufinus, an important source of early
                    Christian history. Although the book may have been copied at the cathedral priory of Christ Church,
                    Canterbury, not long after that it was recorded in the library catalogue of the cathedral priory of
                    St Andrew in Rochester. It was almost certainly copied from an earlier Christ Church copy of the
                    same text (<ref type="ms" target="CCC187">CCCC MS 187</ref> copied c. 1100), since both manuscripts
                    share a common omission from Book XI of the <title>Historia</title>. It is one of several

                    1541. Martin Bucer (1491-1551) was an influential German reformation theologian who moved to England
                    in 1549 as a result of Archbishop Cranmer's invitation and Bucer's refusal to accept the Augsburg
                    Interim (the temporary agreement brokered between the Catholics and Protestants at the Diet of
                    Augsburg in 1548).</p>

            <div xml:id="CCC186" n="MS 186">
                <p>CCCC MS 186 contains thirteenth-century copies of three works of William de Montibus (d. 1213),
                        <title>Distinctiones theologicae</title>, <title>Versarius</title> and <title>Numerale</title>.
                    William de Montibus' works of pastoral theology that emphasised practical care of souls over dogma
                    were extremely influential in late medieval and early modern theology. There are no clues as to the
                    provenance of this manuscript.</p>
            </div>
            <div xml:id="CCC187" n="MS 187">
                <p>CCCC MS 187 contains the translation by Rufinus (c. 345-410) of Eusebius of Caesarea (c. 260-c. 340),
                        <title>Historia ecclesiastica</title> and was written at the end of the eleventh century or
                    start of the twelfth. It has certain later provenance at the cathedral priory of Christ Church,
                    Canterbury and may have been written there, but since it is not in the typical Christ Church script
                    of this time, it may have been imported from elsewhere in England. At some point in the first
                    quarter of the twelfth century <ref type="ms" target="CCC184">CCCC MS 184</ref> was copied from it
                    either at or for Rochester, incorporating a textual omission from CCCC MS 187. The omission in CCCC
                    MS 187 was rectified at some point in the twelfth century, while the Rochester copy's lacuna
                    remained. This suggests that CCCC MS 187 was compared with another exemplar of the work at
                    Canterbury.</p>
            </div>
            <div xml:id="CCC188" n="MS 188">
                <p>CCCC MS 188 contains most of the first series of Ælfric's Catholic Homilies, with a few supplementary
                    pieces also by Ælfric OSB (d. c. 1010). It probably originally contained the whole of the first
                    series, but some material has been lost. It was written in the first half of the eleventh century.
                    Because of a note it contains (recording the copying of a new homily before it was sent to Bishop
                    Æthelwold), it has been argued that this manuscript is a faithful copy of one prepared under the
                    supervision of Ælfric himself at Eynsham where he was abbot, and represents an official revision of
                    his first series of Catholic Homilies. We know that Parker received some Old English manuscripts
                    from Hereford, and it has been suggested that MS 188 was one of these, but on no very firm
                    grounds.</p>
            </div>
            <div xml:id="CCC189" n="MS 189">
                <p>CCCC MS 189 is made up of two volumes. The first section is a collection of documents relating to
                    Canterbury including a chronology, copies of Anglo-Saxon charters and papal letters copied in the
                    later fourteenth century but with material added to in later years down to the reign of Henry VI.
                    The second volume is one of two surviving copies of William Thorne's (fl. c. 1397)
                        <title>Chronicle</title> (to 1375) (the other copy, to 1397, being in British Library, Add. MS
                    53710). The provenance of this manuscript is well attested. It was almost certainly acquired after
                    the Dissolution from St Augustine's, Canterbury by the antiquarian John Twyne (c. 1501-81).
                    Thereafter, a note in the manuscript records how it was in the possession of Thomas Twyne
                    (1543-1613), John Twyne's son, and was given to Parker by Robert Breacher, a former monk of St
                    Augustine's and royal chaplain to Elizabeth I.</p>
            </div>
            <div xml:id="CCC190" n="MS 190">
                <p>CCCC MS 190 is a very complex and interesting volume, with multiple layers of additions and
                    alterations. It was made over the course of the eleventh century, with at least some parts written
                    at Exeter, where it has later provenance. At its core is a version of the collection known as
                    "Archbishop Wulfstan's Handbook", a miscellany on largely ecclesiastical matters which seems to have
                    been compiled by Wulfstan (d. 1023), archbishop of York, for use in his composition of law codes and
                    homilies. This occupies most of pp. 1-294, and has a contemporary contents list which does not,
                    however, correspond precisely to the volume's actual contents. It is in Latin, and has a number of
                    interesting additions like a text assigning penances to those who had fought at the Battle of
                    Hastings (1066). The second part of the book has many Old English texts, including translations of
                    some of the material which is found in the first part, and more ecclesiastical material of a similar
                    nature, such as law codes. The manuscript was valued by Parker for its insights into the Anglo-Saxon
                    church.</p>

            <div xml:id="CCC191" n="MS 191">
                <p> CCCC MS 191 is a copy of the bilingual version of the Rule for Canons of Chrodegang of Metz (d.
                    766). It was written in the third quarter of the eleventh century at Exeter, and is probably
                    identifiable as one of the manuscripts given to Exeter by Bishop Leofric (1050-72). Leofric, who was
                    probably from Cornwall although he has an English name, was brought up in Lotharingia, where he
                    encountered Chrodegang's Rule, which sought to encourage communal life among the secular, rather
                    than monastic, clergy. Leofric introduced this rule to Exeter, which he reconstituted as a community
                    of clerics rather than monks when he moved his see there from Crediton in 1050. This manuscript was
                    used by the Parkerian circle for its Old English vocabulary and was annotated by Parker when he was
                    preparing his defence of priests' marriage.</p>
            </div>
            <div xml:id="CCC192" n="MS 192">
                <p>This manuscript contains a copy of the <title>Liber officialis</title> of Amalarius of Metz (d. c.
                    850), written in Brittany, at the monastery of Landévennec, in the year 952. We can identify the
                    year the manuscript was written on account of a scribal colophon, in fact the work of two scribes,
                    on f. 97v, which contains detailed chronological information from a paschal table. The colophon also
                    tells us that 'Amadeus, deacon and monk, ordered this little book to be written'. The manuscript
                    includes many interlinear glosses, some of them in Breton, which were published by Whitley Stokes.
                    At some point before the thirteenth century the manuscript arrived in England, where it has a
                    provenance at the cathedral priory of Christ Church, Canterbury.</p>

            <div xml:id="CCC193" n="MS 193">
                <p>CCCC MS 193 was written at the end of the eighth century at a centre which wrote the Corbie "ab" type
                    of pre-Caroline minuscule, perhaps Saint Médard, Soissons, where it seems to have early provenance.
                    It contains one of the oldest surviving copies of Ambrose's <title>Hexameron</title>, a commentary
                    on the six days of creation containing much interesting scientific knowledge. It is not clear when
                    it came to England, but it may have arrived in the eleventh century. In 1903 James tentatively
                    suggested it might be identifiable with an entry in Eastry's catalogue of the library of the
                    cathedral priory of Christ Church, Canterbury, but he later abandoned this identification.</p>

                <p>CCCC MS 194 is a miscellany of texts of various periods 'diuersis temporibus et a diuersis
                    scriptoribus exaratus' but mostly copied in the mid-fifteenth century. It contains a copy of Peter
                    of Blois (d. 1212), <title>De conuersione beati Pauli</title>, an extract from the
                    pseudo-Augustinian <title>De spiritu et anima</title> (<title>De creatione primi hominis</title>),
                    the profusely illustrated anonymous <title>Scala mundi</title> chronicle, Martin of Troppau OP (d.
                    1278), <title>Chronica pontificum et imperatorum</title> and <title>Compilatio de gestis Britonum et
                        Anglorum</title> of Peter of Ickham OSB (d. 1295). The <title>Scala mundi</title> contains a
                    well-known early image of Stonehenge, and the historical nature of much of the material in this
                    manuscript surely explains Parker's interest in it. A shelf mark reveals that this manuscript was
                    once in the library of the Hospital of St Mary without Bishopsgate, London, though how it came to be
                    in Parker's collection is unknown.</p>

                    The majority of the text was copied in the second quarter of the fifteenth century, but lacunae have
                    been filled in a sixteenth-century hand with a version of the text perhaps taken from London,
                    College of Arms MS Arundel VII. This manuscript, which was once in the hands of the historian John
                    Bale (1495-1563) before passing to Parker, was used by Parker as the basis for his edition of the
                        <title>Historia breuis</title> published in 1574.</p>

                    separated by Parker. They were made at Exeter in the time of Bishop Leofric (1050-72). MS 196 is an
                    important manuscript of the Old English martyrology, though missing some material for December to
                    March: Kotzor used it as the base text for his edition from 19 March to 21 December. It also
                    contains the Old English <title>Vindicta saluatoris</title>, a translation of an apocryphon which
                    interprets the destruction of the Jewish Temple by Titus in A.D. 70 as motivated by his desire to
                    avenge the Crucifixion upon the Jews. Parker obtained several volumes from Exeter Cathedral, some
                    decades before the majority of its medieval manuscripts were given to the Bodleian Library in
                    1602.</p>

                    documents) and material relating to the treason and death of Archbishop Scrope (c. 1350-1405). The
                    rest of the manuscript is taken up with continuations of Ranulf Higden OSB (d. 1364),
                        <title>Polychronicon</title> including the unique version commonly called <title>The Westminster

                    of the manuscript has been given a dating of c. 1400-25. Although the various elements of CCCC MS

                <p>This manuscript constitutes the surviving portion of the 'Cotton-Corpus' Gospels; the larger part,
                    now London, BL MS Cotton Otho C. V, was badly damaged in the Cottonian fire of 1731 and only burnt
                    fragments remain. A bifolium of canon tables, probably also from this manuscript, survives as
                    London, BL MS Royal 7. C. XII, ff. 2-3. The original manuscript was a lavish Insular Gospel Book
                    with elaborate decoration; in the Corpus part the eagle symbol of St John the evangelist still
                    survives, and elaborate decorative initials incorporating a range of interlace and other ornament.
                    It belongs in a group with the Durham Gospels, the Echternach Gospels, and the Lindisfarne Gospels.
                    Both Parker and Cotton recorded on their respective parts of the original book that it was believed
                    to have been owned by St Augustine, first archbishop of Canterbury, who was sent by Pope Gregory the
                    Great to England in 597. The date of the manuscript rules this out: it seems to be from late
                    seventh- or early eighth-century Northumbria. However it is possible that this tradition arose in
                    the Middle Ages, as one of the volumes which Thomas Elmham (d. c. 1427) recorded among those revered
                    as sent from Gregory to Augustine was probably an early Insular Gospel-book of this type. The same
                    provenance was attributed anachronistically to other early Anglo-Saxon manuscripts at St
                    Augustine's, Canterbury.</p>

                <p>CCCC MS 198 is an important collection of Old English homilies, mostly by Ælfric of Eynsham OSB (c.
                    950-c. 1010). It was written in the first half of the eleventh century and received a number of
                    additions in the second half. It also contains a neumed office for St Guthlac added towards the end
                    of the eleventh century. The manuscript may have been written at Worcester; although the textual
                    associations of the main body are south-eastern, the additions appear from their spellings to be
                    from the west of England, and in the thirteenth century it was annotated by the scribe known as the
                    'Worcester Tremulous Hand'. It was Parker's fourth volume of homilies in his numeration system.</p>

                    Fawr by Ieuan ap Sulien (d. 1137). Ieuan was from a prominent literary family; his brother,
                    Rhigyfarch (d. 1099), wrote a Life of St David and succeeded his father, Sulien (d. 1091), as bishop
                    of St David's. Some of Ieuan's own verses in Latin and Welsh survive in the margins of this
                    manuscript, but unfortunately part of the Welsh verse was lost in 1953 when the manuscript was
                    rebound. The main text of this manuscript is written in a very attractive hand, with some beautiful
                    decorated initials. The flyleaf contains a ninth-century fragment of Smaragdus (fl. 809-17) in a
                    Carolingian minuscule, possibly from Rheims.</p>

                    1190), contained in CCCC MS 200, was written in the period 1170-80. This copy was produced after he
                    became archbishop in 1184 because an historiated initial at the beginning of the text shows him
                    writing and wearing a mitre. The text discusses the biblical sources of the eucharist, foreshadowed
                    in the paschal lamb and manna of the Old Testament, and defined in the New Testament writings of
                    Saints Matthew, John and Paul. The book belonged to Christ Church cathedral priory, Canterbury.</p>

                <p>CCCC MS 201 is a composite volume which can be divided chronologically into three parts, probably
                    first bound together by Parker. Pp. 1-7 and 161-7 are the oldest, written in the early eleventh
                    century; they contain a fragment of the Old English <title>Regularis concordia</title>, the code of
                    monastic observance, and some Old English religious poems, most notably <title>Judgement Day
                        II</title>, a translation of Bede's <title>De die iudicii</title>. The rest of the volume up to
                    p. 178 was written probably in the first half or middle of the eleventh century, and contains a
                    large number of sermons by Archbishop Wulfstan (d. 1023), as well as a collection of ecclesiastical
                    material, mostly in the vernacular. It has been interpreted as a version of Archbishop Wulfstan's
                    Handbook. It contains several law codes, predominantly the work of Wulfstan himself, the Old English
                    tract on the resting places of saints, and the Old English romance <title>Apollonius of
                    Tyre</title>. Bishop identified a scribe in this section of the book as working at the New Minster,
                    Winchester, but a Worcester or York association has also been suggested, since these were the main
                    seats of Wulfstan himself. The third part was written at Exeter in the time of Bishop Leofric
                    (1050-72) and was probably once part of <ref type="ms" target="CCC196">CCCC MS 196</ref>. It
                    contains the bilingual version of Theodulf of Orléans (d. 821), <title>Capitula</title>, a homily,
                    and part of the Martyrology of Usuard (fl. 841-58). This manuscript did not come to Corpus Christi
                    with the rest of the Corpus Parkerian collection in 1575, and is not included in the Parker
                    Register; instead it was one of the large number of books which Archbishop Parker gave to his son
                    John Parker, who played an active role in his father's circle of scholarship. It had arrived at
                    Corpus by 1600, before the later financial troubles which probably led to the majority of John
                    Parker's books travelling to Trinity College via the gift of Neville. The manuscript later acquired
                    a contents-list by the great Anglo-Saxonist Abraham Wheelock (d. 1653).</p>

                    well as the provisions of a Church Council relating to monastic affairs. The late twelfth-century
                    material is largely Classical or Late Antique, including introductory material on Sidonius
                    Apollinaris and Fulgentius, and the florilegium of the letters of Symmachus. The second part of the
                    manuscript, possibly thirteenth century, contains a copy of Proverbs and Ecclesiastes, with
                    extensive marginal and interlinear glosses.</p>

                    (1270-1340). His biblical commentaries, which also included the Old Testament, were very popular in
                    the later centuries of the Middle Ages and the early modern period. A large number of manuscript and
                    early printed copies survive. The manuscript dates to the first quarter of the fifteenth century and

                    moral commentary rather than the full text. Stephen Langton (c. 1150-1228) wrote numerous
                    commentaries on the books of the Old and New Testaments, and is among the most important of early
                    scholastic commentators. The manuscript was written in the thirteenth century and contains a later,

                    James' catalogue records the presence of this manuscript in Corpus Christi by 1600, it does not
                    appear in Parker's register. The volume appears to have been intended as a gift for Thomas

                    Although there has been much debate about its origins, it was probably written in England in the
                    first half of the tenth century. The script is a form of Caroline minuscule with many Insular
                    abbreviations, and both North East France and Wales have also been suggested as possible places of
                    origin. It was never owned by Parker, and probably came to Corpus from the collection of Daniel

                    history, biography and geography reflect a lively and curious mind. How this manuscript came into
                    Parker's possession is unknown, and it has been suggested that the codex was another bequest to the

                    Montibus, <title>Speculum poenitentis</title>, is an early and reliable one in terms of that work's
                    textual history. There is a much better version of the text of <title>Pictor in carmine</title> in

                    is parallelled with the sickness of the soul. Christ, as the doctor, heals the five senses from
                    infection by the seven deadly sins. The book is of particular importance to the College because
                    Henry of Lancaster played an important role in its foundation in the middle years of the fourteenth
                    century and is commemorated as one of its great benefactors.</p>

                <p>CCCC MS 221 consists of two volumes bound together to make a collection of works on orthography by
                    Alcuin, Bede, Cassiodorus, Flavius Caper, and Agroecius. The first part, containing the works by
                    Alcuin and Bede, was probably written at a Breton centre on the Continent in the first half of the
                    tenth century. It has a few marginal notes in Tironian shorthand. The second part, which is probably
                    tenth-century, may be either Continental or English. Because Bishop thought that the first part
                    shares a scribe with Cambridge, Gonville and Caius, MS 144/194, a manuscript with certain medieval
                    provenance at St Augustine's, Canterbury, this manuscript has been associated with St Augustine's as
                    well. However, its complete lack of St Augustine's provenance marks does make that less likely. It
                    was one of the manuscripts which came to Corpus from the collection of Daniel Rogers, who acquired

                    famous <title>Psychomachia</title>, as well as the unique surviving copy of a poem by John Scotus
                    Eriugena (c. 810-c. 877) to the Carolingian emperor, Charles the Bald. It was written at the abbey
                    of Saint-Vaast in Arras around the third quarter of the ninth century. By the end of the ninth
                    century it had moved to the abbey of Saint-Bertin at Saint-Omer, where some annals were added to
                    leaves at the front. In the tenth century it moved to England, and where it acquired additions and
                    glosses, some in Old English. It has been suggested that Grimbald of Saint-Bertin, who came to
                    England in the 890s at the request of King Alfred, may have brought this manuscript with him. This

                    text for the medieval university curriculum, and the script and ornament suggests this copy might
                    have been made in Oxford. Although now partly rebound with modern binding, part of the red skin
                    medieval binding survives, with evidence that it once had clasps, and there is some indication of
                    marks for the attachment of a chain.</p>

                        Neustriae</title> often, and probably mistakenly, attributed to Thomas Walsingham (c. 1370-c.
                    1422). The <title>Ypodigma Neustriae</title> is a chronicle of events in Normandy and England from
                    911 to 1416 and written, perhaps, as a flattery to Henry V's successful conquests in France. Its
                    dating can probably be narrowed down to c. 1419. Nothing is known of how this manuscript came to be
                    in Parker's collection, though it was, presumably, one of the many manuscripts dealing with
                    historical themes that the archbishop acquired from the monastery of St Alban, Hertfordshire which
                    had produced some of the greatest medieval English monastic chroniclers. See also <ref type="ms"

                    with a continuation 1305-12, probably by an anonymous Durham continuator. Walter of Guisborough (fl.
                    c.1290–c.1305) (also known as Walter 'of Hemingford' or 'of Hemingburgh') was an Augustinian canon
                    of the priory of St Mary at Guisborough. The early portion of the chronicle draws heavily on the
                    chronicle of William of Newburgh OSA (d. after 1199), the <title>Historia post Bedam</title> and
                    other northern sources. The roughly contemporary portion of the chronicle shows some similarities to
                    other Northern histories of the period but is considered to be an independent chronicle. The

                    emphasis on events pertinent to the abbey at Bury St Edmunds. Both texts were written c. 1445. Even
                    though the press mark ('E.43') appears to be in error, since manuscripts at Bury St Edmunds were
                    classified by subject matter - the volume, M. R. James argued, should fall under 'C' for
                        <title>Chronica</title> - James had no doubt the manuscript was from Bury on the grounds of the
                    content which, as part of the chronicle material, includes a life of St Edmund. Also recorded in

                    in several different hands in the margins of the text, it would appear that a succession of canon
                    lawyers regarded this volume as their working copy of an important text for church discipline and
                    government. There is no clue as to the manuscript's provenance, though presumably Parker acquired it

                    Both must be considered essentially anonymous, despite the fact that the <title>Musica
                        enchiriadis</title> is in this manuscript attributed to Hoger of Laon (d. 930); in the Corpus
                    catalogue James attributed them to Hucbald of Saint-Amand (d. c. 930) and Odo of Cluny OSB (c.
                    879-942) respectively. Together they provide some of the earliest evidence for polyphony, and use a
                    type of notation known as Dasian, which allows for precise pitch to be recorded. Parker wrote "TW"
                    in this manuscript, perhaps to indicate that he acquired it from John Twyne, a Canterbury
                    schoolmaster and antiquary who had worked at St Augustine's before the Dissolution; or
                    alternatively, from Thomas Wotton (c. 1521-87), nephew of Nicholas Wotton dean of Canterbury, and an
                    associate of Parker with Puritan sympathies.</p>

                    1307 and 1316 (probably c. 1313). He was the only English-educated writer on medical matters to gain
                    some recognition among the schools of mainland Europe, and it is sometimes stated that Chaucer
                    modelled his <title>Doctor of Physik</title> on Gaddesden. Whether that is the case or not, he was
                    certainly regarded as a talented physician, gaining employment within the household of Edward the
                    Black Prince, who rewarded him with a rose made of gold, perhaps in a reference to Gaddesden's most

                    by Howlett in his edition of 1884, who described it as corrupted and with many elementary copying
                    errors. Nevertheless, the text as found in this manuscript was used for collating the English
                    Historical Society's edition of 1856. This edition was in turn used by Joseph Stevenson as the basis
                    for his translation of the work that also appeared in 1856. The provenance of the manuscript is

                    Benedictine cathedral priory of the Holy Trinity, Christ Church, Canterbury. CCCC MS 263 has
                    received far less scholarly attention than other manuscripts of Honorius' works in the Parker

                    "Wulfstan's Handbook", a compilation made for the use of a confessor, and include an Old English
                    form of confession. This compilation is associated with Wulfstan the homilist (d. 1023), bishop of
                    Worcester and archbishop of York, advisor and legislator for both Æthelred the Unready and Cnut. The
                    bulk of the manuscript is eleventh-century, but it was added to into the twelfth century and beyond.
                    It also contains a twelfth-century copy of Hugh of Fleury OSB (d. 1128/35), <title>Historia

                    almost exaggeratedly English style of script. The same scribe is found in other St Augustine's
                    books, and this manuscript is identifiable in the medieval catalogue of the abbey's library. A short
                    text by Peter Damian (1007-72) was added not long after the manuscript was written. A
                    near-contemporary copy of a neumed hymn to St Mellitus, the third archbishop of Canterbury, is now
                    at the front of the book, but because it is codicologically separable it may not always have been
                    part of this manuscript. In the fifteenth century a short prophetic poem by John Thwing of
                    Bridlington OSA (d. 1379) was added at the back of the volume. The chronicle section contains fine

                    texts. An inscription records its ownership in the fifteenth century by the Augustinian nun,
                    Elizabeth Wylby, of Campsey Priory (Suffolk). Of the texts in the book, two are anonymous, although
                    one claims to contain extracts in Middle English from Henry Suso OP (1295-1366), <title>Horologium
                        sapientiae</title>. The other texts are attributed to Walter Hilton (c. 1343-96), the Book of
                    Contemplation, in two parts. Late in his life in 1386, Walter became an Augustinian canon at

                    nationale de France MS lat. 12519 and Biblioteca Apostolica Vaticana MS lat. 1363), and the only one
                    with a known English provenance. Originally dating from the twelfth century, a fifteenth-century
                    inscription records that this volume was then in the library of the Cistercian abbey of the Blessed
                    Virgin Mary at Pipewell in Northamptonshire. If it was still at Pipewell at the time of the abbey's
                    dissolution in 1538, it was fortunate to survive the looting that followed that event. Perhaps it
                    was removed together with the other fixtures and fittings of the abbey that were granted to Sir
                    William Parr, brother of Katherine Parr, Henry VIII's last wife.</p>

                <p>This Missal is written in the beautiful round script particularly associated with St Augustine's
                    Abbey, Canterbury, in the second half of the eleventh century. We know that this manuscript was
                    written after 1091 because it contains a mass for the translation of St Augustine in this year. As
                    such it shows the typical English script of the eleventh century being written well after the Norman
                    Conquest, in contrast to the spiky script written at nearby Christ Church at this time. T. A. M.
                    Bishop identified the work of some of CCCC MS 270's scribes in other manuscripts from St
                    Augustine's, Canterbury. Arguments on textual grounds that the manuscript must have been written
                    before 1100 are unconvincing in themselves, but this style of script would not be expected to have
                    lasted very long into the twelfth century. The manuscript has flyleaves written in late eleventh- or
                    twelfth-century script, containing text from Bede's <title>Historia ecclesiastica</title>. It is
                    possible that these leaves were not taken from a dismantled copy of Bede's work, but were rather
                    leaves rejected during the production of a manuscript, and if so then they may have been used in the
                    binding of MS 270 at an early date.</p>

                <p>CCCC MS 271 was in the library of St Augustine's, Canterbury, where it once comprised two separate
                    volumes that were first bound together in the fourteenth century. The first volume, containing the
                        <title>Decretales</title> of Gregory IX, was donated to the abbey by a monk of St Augustine's,
                    Martin de Totynton (fl. c. 1300), while the second part, containing the <title>Decretals</title> of
                    Boniface VIII (<title>Liber sextus</title>), was donated by one 'Abbot T.'. This is probably abbot
                    Thomas Findon (1283-1310) or possibly Thomas Poucyn (1334-43). A fourteenth-century hand has added
                    the <title>Constitutions</title> of Archbishops Langton, Boniface and Pecham to the second volume.
                    It presumably found its way into Parker's collection from St Augustine's.</p>

            <div xml:id="CCC272" n="MS 272">
                <p>This manuscript is known as the 'Achadeus Psalter' because of an inscription after Psalm 150
                    recording that Count Achadeus ordered it to be made. This need not imply, however, that Achadeus
                    owned the book, or had any closer connection with it than simply paying for its materials. As well
                    as the psalms and canticles the manuscript contains Psalter collects, a litany, and prayers. The
                    litany includes mention of Pope Marinus (882-4), King Carloman (882-3), and Fulk, bishop of Rheims
                    (883-900), and has on these grounds been dated to 883/4; the mention of Bishop Fulk and of local
                    saints locates its use to Rheims. Although not necessarily made in the city itself, it seems to be
                    from that region of France. CCCC MS 272 contains extensive marginal glosses largely taken from
                    Cassiodorus' <title>Expositio psalmorum</title>. They are written in that form of English Caroline
                    minuscule which developed in the first quarter of the eleventh century and continued in use until
                    after the Norman Conquest. Consequently it seems that the manuscript was in England in the eleventh
                    century; it has been suggested that it was brought over earlier than that, perhaps even by Grimbald
                    of Saint-Bertin, who was sent to England by Fulk of Rheims in order to assist King Alfred the Great
                    with his revival of English learning. If so the manuscript must have left Rheims relatively soon
                    after it was made, as Grimbald was at Winchester by 887, and doubt has been expressed over whether a
                    manuscript sponsored by an important count would have been lightly alienated. The manuscript has
                    illumination in gold and colours and originally had large illuminated initials at the liturgical
                    divisions of the Psalter, although all save that for Psalm 97 have been cut out. The Litany has
                    elaborate arched column frames, and at the beginning of the Psalter a large B ornamental initial for
                    the first psalm from an English early thirteenth-century Psalter has been inserted. MS 272 was
                    certainly at Canterbury in the later middle ages, where parts of account rolls of Christ Church
                    Canterbury are used as its endleaves.</p>

                    later medieval provenance at Worcester. The textual content of the manuscript is derived from Irish
                    and Breton sources; the contents include the only extant copy of the canons of the 'First Synod of
                    Patrick', a copy of the <title>Liber ex lege Moysi</title>, whose Irish connections are the subject
                    of some debate, and a copy of the <title>Collectio canonum Hibernensis</title>. The manuscript is
                    particularly important as a witness to the Breton, and later English, transmission of the
                        <title>Collectio</title>. There are additional glosses in Breton and Old Irish, although the
                    latter were copied into the manuscript by a Breton scribe, resulting in some orthographical

                    King Edward I's relations with Scotland. The manuscript has sometimes been described as having once

                    by Adelard of Bath (c. 1080-c. 1150). There has been some dispute as to its provenance, with M. R.

                    consists of a miscellany of liturgical texts: Office of the Dead, Penitential and Gradual psalms, a
                    Sarum litany, an unidentified Benedictine litany and a litany of the abbey of St Augustine's,

                    argued, was a reworking of the pseudo-Elmham's <title>Vita et Gesta Henrici Quinti</title>. Written
                    while Frulovisi was in England in the later 1430s, perhaps 1436-8, the manuscript was once in the
                    possession of Henry VI, though how it came to be in Parker's possession is not known. It was
                    presumably Parker who bound this fifteenth-century humanist text together, somewhat incongruously,
                    with a tenth- or early eleventh-century copy of <title>De laudibus uirginitatis</title> (<title>De
                        virginitate</title>) by Aldhelm (d. 709) to which have been added glosses in a hand identified

                <p>CCCC MS 286 is the famous manuscript known as the St Augustine Gospels. This is a late sixth-century
                    gospelbook which has for centuries been held to have been sent by Pope Gregory the Great with
                    Augustine of Canterbury (d. 604) when he arrived to christianise the English in 597. Certainly the
                    manuscript was in Canterbury by the end of the seventh century, and various additions were made
                    there, including some tenth-century Anglo-Saxon charters written between the gospels of Matthew and
                    Mark. Whether owned by Augustine himself, it almost certainly came to England with one of the early
                    waves of Roman missionaries; on occasion it has also been associated with St Mellitus (d. 624), and
                    with Minster-in-Thanet (Kent). CCCC MS 286 is the earliest surviving Gospel Book with figure
                    illumination: although most of it has been lost, with only a picture of Luke as a scribe under an
                    arcade, and a page of gospel images in a grid. Unfortunately, only these two of the probably eight
                    full-page pictures which the book contained have survived. These images seem to have been highly
                    influential on later English art; a number of Anglo-Saxon and Romanesque manuscripts seem to owe a
                    debt to its imagery, as does a famous scene in the Bayeux Tapestry. In the later Middle Ages this
                    manuscript was probably kept on the altar at St Augustine's, Canterbury, where Thomas of Elmham
                    describes a number of manuscripts associated with Augustine being kept. Unfortunately, most of these
                    are demonstrably later than Augustine's time. Parker may have been unaware of its assocation with
                    the Gregorian mission. In recent years it has continued to play a role outside the library: since
                    the Second World War it has been used in the enthronement of archbishops of Canterbury, and in 1982
                    it was put in the place of honour between Pope John Paul II and Archbishop Robert Runcie during the
                    first papal visit to England since the Reformation.</p>

                        Westmonasterii</title> by John Flete OSB (c.1398-1466), an important history of Westminster
                    Abbey. Then follows a history of the bishops of Ely up to 1434 with a list of their names. At the

                    anonymous liturgical tract on church offices and a tract on the Mass by Richard the
                    Premonstratensian (fl. late twelfth century). Parts of the book contain apocrypha of the New
                    Testament such as the <title>Gospel of Nicodemus</title> and the <title>De ortu beatae Mariae et
                        infantia saluatoris</title>. Other parts contain prophetic texts such as some by Hildegard of
                    Bingen OSB (1098-1179) and the <title>De initio et fine saeculi</title> (<title>Revelations</title>)
                    of pseudo-Methodius. The book belonged to N de Sandwico (Sandwich, Kent), a monk of the cathedral
                    priory of Christ Church, Canterbury, and can perhaps be identified with an item in the early
                    fourteenth-century library catalogue by Henry of Eastry.</p>

                <p>CCCC MS 289 is a twelfth-century compilation of texts on aspects of Christian doctrine. The
                    manuscript was written by two hands, both of which are very fine. The texts contained in the

                    1040-1115), Bruno of Asti (d. 1125) and Walter of Mortagne (d. 1174). James suggested that the book
                    might be identified with a manuscript found in the early fourteenth-century catalogue of Christ
                    Church, Canterbury, compiled under Henry of Eastry (1284-1331), but this is by no means certain.</p>

                    history, of which the main texts are the <title>Chronicon</title> (<title>De sex aetatibus
                        mundi</title>) of Ado of Vienne (d. 875), followed by genealogies of the Frankish kings and the
                    dukes of Normandy. In the early fourteenth century the <title>Registrum Anglie</title> recorded that
                    the manuscript was still at St Albans. The flyleaves preserve deeds bearing the date 1521 and a
                    notarial mark which mentions John Dowman (or Dolman) LLD (d.1524), elected Vice-Chancellor of

                    Canterbury in the late eleventh or early twelfth century. The calculation of the date of Easter,
                    known as computus, is both very complex and very important to the church year; this compilation
                    explains the theoretical calculations as well as providing relevant tables. Bede's <title>De
                        temporum ratione</title>, the main text in the book, was a very popular work in the Middle Ages,
                    and remains a useful guide to computus; but there is an interesting disparity between Bede's
                    insistence that one should be able to divide by nineteen in one's head, and the table on f. 137
                    which lays out addition, subtraction and multiplication starting with 1 + 1 is 2. At the end the
                    manuscript contains a full Easter table for 1064 to 1595, a complete Dionysiac Great Paschal Cycle
                    (532 years, the product of the 19-year lunar cycle and the 28-year cycle of days of the week). The
                    book is written throughout in late Anglo-Caroline minuscule, although the decorated initials show
                    Norman influence; this gives an interesting insight into the cultural influences at work at St

                <p>CCCC MS 297 is an interesting manuscript because of its very ordinariness. It contains a number of
                    disparate texts copied at Thorney Abbey in Cambridgeshire between the early thirteenth and
                    fourteenth centuries, including copies of legal material such as the <title>Statuta
                        abbreviata</title> and an account of a dispute involving the abbot of Thorney, together with
                    tracts on diplomatic practice, husbandry, medicine (both human and veterinary) and accounting. The
                    suggestion must be that this volume was one of very many created as a commonplace book either for a
                    monastic administrator or as a more general source of information useful to a monastic
                    community.</p>

                    written in 1497 by Laurence Wade OSB.The second part contains a collection of documents relating to
                    the history and landholdings of Canterbury and the archbishops and dates to the early sixteenth
                    century. The third part consists of an early fifteenth-century copy of the <title>Chronica
                        pontificum ecclesiae Eboracensis</title> of Thomas Stubbs OP (d. 1381), with an anonymous
                    continuation and two collection of documents. The chronicle is a history of the church of York
                    covering the period 1147-1373. The fourth part contains a variety of letters, canons and excerpts
                    from longer texts written in a Parkerian hand of the sixteenth century.</p>

                    to John Tille OP (d. 1410). Tille donated this manuscript to the Dominicans of London, of which
                    convent he was a member. He also donated <ref type="ms" target="CCC306">CCCC MS 306</ref> and
                    Cambridge, Trinity College MS O.2.50 to the same house. The manuscript contains the letters of

                    provided with typological parallels from the Old, all having accompanying verses. This manuscript,
                    dating from the thirteenth century, contains the long version of the text which exists in six other
                    MSS. The work has been attributed to Adam of Dore OCist, who was Abbot of Dore (Herefordshire) and
                    died at some time after 1216. The text has been edited from this manuscript by K.-A. Wirth.</p>

                <p>CCCC MS 301 contains a number of texts relating to St Augustine's, Canterbury, copied in the early
                    fourteenth century. Among the texts included in the volume are two chronicles; one describing events
                    from the arrival of Brutus in England to the accession of Henry III derived firstly from Bede, and
                    from English twelfth-century writers such as Geoffrey of Monmouth (d. 1154), William of Malmesbury
                    OSB (c. 1080-1143), Henry of Huntingdon (1084-1155) and Roger of Howden (d. c. 1201). The other
                    chronicle is based on a foreign source and covers the period from the Incarnation to 1316. In
                    addition, this manuscript contains an early fourteenth-century Anglo-Norman copy of the
                        <title>Hosebandrie</title> of Walter of Henley (d. c. 1290/1300), a treatise on estate
                    management and accounting, and a number of veterinary recipes, also in Anglo-Norman. The book was
                    donated to St Augustine's by Stephen de Hackyngton (fl. 1332). Matthew Parker no doubt valued it for
                    the light it shed on the history of Canterbury, a recurring theme in his collection.</p>

                <p>CCCC MS 302 is an important collection of Old English homilies, mostly by Ælfric of Eynsham (c.
                    950-c. 1010). It was written in the early twelfth century, probably in south-east England. It
                    contains late Old English spellings, and is an important witness to the use made of the Anglo-Saxon
                    homiletic tradition after the Norman Conquest. It was Parker's fifth volume of homilies in his
                    numeration system.</p>

                <p>CCCC MS 303 is an interesting witness to the fate of the Old English language after the Norman
                    Conquest led to the replacement of much of the English elite with French-speaking Normans.
                    Manuscripts of Old English homilies were still produced at least as frequently as they had been in
                    the period before the Conquest; contrary to popular misconception Old English seems to have
                    continued in use. MS 303 is a collection of Old English homilies, many of them by Ælfric of Eynsham
                    (c. 950-c. 1010), copied in the first half of the twelfth century in the south east of England,
                    probably at Rochester. An old foliation shows that several quires have been lost from the start of
                    this manuscript. Parker gave it the number 9 in his collection of homiletic manuscripts.</p>

                    paraphrase of the gospels in Virgilian language composed in the fourth century by this aristocratic
                    Spanish priest. It also contains the earliest known version of some verses by Isidore of Seville (c.
                    560-636). This manuscript was written in the first half of the eighth century in Uncial script. E.
                    A. Lowe changed his mind about this manuscript between the two editions of the second volume of his
                        <title>Codices Latini Antiquiores</title>: in the first he considered it to be Spanish, in the
                    second Italian. It seems to have reached England by the tenth century, perhaps at Christ Church,
                    Canterbury or Malmesbury, and may be identifiable with an item in the Christ Church library

                    likely. It also has two acrostic poems on Guthlac, which have become corrupt in copying. The second
                    part of the manuscript is a fourteenth-century collection of works by John Waleys OFM (d. 1285), and

                    fifteenth- or early sixteenth-century hand that continues the account of events to 1437, and which
                    belongs to the family of extended versions that may have served as a textual model for the Middle
                    English 'Peculiar Version'. John Bale (1495-1563), the historian, mentions that such a text, with
                    the same incipit, was in the possession of one William Carey 'scriba' of Cheapside in the
                    mid-sixteenth century. This provenance is supported by a note on one of the flyleaves mentioning Dr
                    Edward Wotton (d.1555), a renowned physician who seems to have practiced in the Cheapside area of

                    hagiographical material concerning St Augustine of Canterbury, predominantly by Goscelin of
                    Canterbury OSB (d. after 1114), formerly a monk of St Bertin. Goscelin came to England either
                    shortly before or shortly after the Norman Conquest, later becoming a monk of St Augustine's
                    Canterbury, and had a flourishing career as a hagiographer, especially of native English saints. He
                    wrote a number of works for the translations of major Canterbury saints in 1091, including these St
                    Augustine texts. This manuscript was written in the mid-twelfth century, and includes liturgical
                    material with music. Like <ref type="ms" target="CCC050">CCCC MS 50</ref> it seems to have been
                    owned by someone called Bachon, who wrote his name in it accompanied by a little flower, before it

                        Livio</title> of Lucius Annaeus Florus (fl. c. 140), an account of Roman history, and the

                    Incarnation to his own day comprised of extracts from his own and other authors' works. Although
                    such material appealed to Parker, there is very little clues as to how this manuscript came into
                    Parker's possession apart from the name 'Byny' written in Parker's characteristic red chalk on one

                    poems by Eriugena, but they are textually corrupt and were not used for Herren's edition. The
                    manuscript is of late thirteenth- or early fourteenth-century date, and is from the Benedictine

                    Andrew's works. Members of the Victorine school focused exclusively on the books of the Old
                    Testament, but while Richard's commentaries are allegorical, Andrew's are historical. It should be
                    noted that the text which was previously thought to be a commentary on Maccabees has now been
                    identified as Andrew's historical Dossier. Van Liere used CCCC MS 315 for his edition of the works
                    of Andrew of Saint-Victor. The manuscript also contains some notes pertaining to a journey during

                    the public notary of Norwich diocese, suggesting that the manuscript may have been in Norwich in the

                    Apostles Creed by John Waldeby (d. after 1372); two pseudo-Augustinian tracts; a tract by John
                    Deverose (d. after 1400); tables of biblical themes and theological concepts and an incomplete copy
                    of <title>Speculum ecclesiae</title> by Edmund of Abingdon (c. 1174-1240), Archbishop of Canterbury
                    (1234-1240), which varies significantly from the Forshaw edition (1973).</p>

                <p>The two parts of CCCC MS 318 may once have been separate manuscripts, but they were certainly
                    together at Rochester in the twelfth century, when a contents list and an anathema were added to the
                    volume. The first part is a twelfth-century collection of hagiography containing vitae of Edward the
                    Confessor, Anselm of Canterbury, Herluin of Bec, and the Venerable Bede. The second part is also a
                    twelfth-century collection of hagiography, but with some romance material as well: it contains texts
                    on James the apostle, Charlemagne and Roland, Bishop Turpin, Thecla, and Apollonius of Tyre. An
                    inscription says that the manuscript was given to Parker by a deacon of Rochester.</p>

                    Petrus Comestor (d. c. 1187), <title>Historia scholastica</title>, apparently reworked by Peter of
                    Poitiers (d. 1205) as indicated in the text on f. 53. The second part of the book is the text on the
                    liturgy by Honorius Augustodunensis (fl. 1106-1135, probably d. 1151), <title>Gemma animae siue De

                    unrelated material bound together. The first volume contains sermons by Geoffrey Babio du Louroux,
                    archbishop of Bordeaux (1135-58), and others, copied in the twelfth century. The second is an
                    Anglo-Saxon Penitential. It contains two Penitential texts and some related material, including the
                        <title>Libellus responsionum</title> found in Bede's <title>Historia ecclesiastica</title> in
                    which Augustine of Canterbury and Gregory the Great correspond about the requirements of moral
                    behaviour for the newly converted Anglo-Saxons. There are also some miscellaneous notes on things
                    like the length of the Ark, and some added Old English material. T. A. M. Bishop linked this
                    manuscript into a network of material written at St Augustine's, Canterbury in the second half of
                    the tenth century or later.</p>

                        <title>Commentary on Matthew</title> and <title>Quaestiones</title>. The texts of these have not
                    been printed, save for extracts. The manuscript has been associated with the Benedictine abbey of
                    Ramsey, but on evidence which Ker thought insufficient. It also contains an important
                    eleventh-century fragment of an Old English dialogue about the word Alleluia, otherwise attested
                    only in BL Harley 3271, and probably based on material from the pseudo-Bedan
                        <title>Collectanea</title>. It is not clear whether Parker placed this fragment in the book, or
                    whether it was already there when he acquired it.</p>

                    Alfred the Great. It is the only surviving witness to large parts of the text. It was written in the
                    second half of the eleventh century probably at Worcester, where it has later provenance. James's
                    suggestion of provenance at Bury St Edmunds, provoked by the form of the manuscript's classmark and
                    the inclusion of a similar manuscript in a Bury booklist, has been rejected by Ker.</p>

                    lives of Pilate and Judas Iscariot. Then follows an anonymous treatise on the liturgical offices,
                    including an exposition on the Mass. The final text is a commentary on the seven penitential psalms
                    attributed to Pope Innocent III ( 1160/61-1216), ending imperfectly. There seems to be no thematic
                    unity between the three parts of the book.</p>

                    manuscript is described as bearing the sign manual of Charles V of France (1338-80), and in 1411 the
                    catalogue of the French royal library recorded this manuscript as still being in the collection at
                    the Louvre palace, where it is described as 'de bonne lettre de forme' in a linen cover with two
                    gold clasps. It contains a miniature of the presentation of the book to Jeanne by her confessor, and

                    of subjects, including those by Vincent of Beauvais OP (1189/94-1264) on the education of children
                    written for the French royal family, <title>De eruditione regalium filiorum</title>, and on facing
                    death, <title>Liber consolatorius ad Ludouicum regem de morte filii</title>. There is also a copy of
                    the advice of Bernard of Clairvaux OCist (1090-1153) on the interpretation of the Benedictine Rule -
                        <title>De praecepto et dispensatione</title>, and his <title>Epistola ad Robertum nepotem
                        suum</title> . The manuscript, copied in a late thirteenth or early fourteenth-century hand, was
                    certainly once in the library of the cathedral priory at Norwich, though mention of the name John de
                    Stratton on the first folio of the codex almost certainly refers to the man who was appointed prior
                    of Norwich's daughter house of St. Mary Magdalen, St. Margaret, and All Virgin Saints at King's Lynn
                    in 1325. The manuscript may have passed through the hands of the historian, John Bale (1495-1563),

                <p>CCCC MS 326 is an interesting manuscript which attests to Latin learning at the cathedral priory of
                    Christ Church, Canterbury at the end of the tenth century and the beginning of the eleventh. It
                    contains the unique text of the macaronic poem <title>Aldhelm</title>, which switches from Latin
                    (with Greek vocabulary) to Old English, phrase by phrase; but its main contents are two particularly
                    difficult Latin texts with glosses. The prose <title>De laudibus uirginitatis</title> by Aldhelm (d.
                    709), and the third book of <title>Bella Parisiacae urbis</title> by Abbo of Saint-Germain-des-Prés
                    (d. 921), were both very influential on the so-called hermeneutic style of Anglo-Latin, which arose
                    in the second half of the tenth century in association with the Benedictine Reform Movement. The
                    manuscript also contains a poem in the shape of a wheel. Provenance at Christ Church, Canterbury is
                    assured by the two surviving classmarks of that house, and the identification of this manuscript in
                    the early fourteenth-century Christ Church catalogue of Henry of Eastry OSB. An origin at the same
                    house seems certain since T. A. M. Bishop identified the scribe as one of those from his large
                    network of Canterbury manuscripts.</p>

                    given at the beginning of the text. The collection is entitled <title>Abjiciamus</title> and is
                    arranged as sermons according to the church year for the Temporal and the Sanctoral (ff. 1-159v).

                <p>CCCC MS 328 consists of two volumes, both hagiographical in nature. The first was written circa 1100,
                    perhaps at Christ Church, Canterbury, and concerns St Dunstan, archbishop of Canterbury 959-88. As
                    well as the <title>Vita</title> by Osbern of Canterbury OSB (d. 1094?), it contains a Mass of St
                    Dunstan with a neumed prosa and an extract from the Life of St Dunstan by Eadmer of Canterbury OSB
                    (d. after 1124). The second volume contains material on Cluniac saints, specifically the Lives of
                    Odo, Maiolus, and Odilo, and a Mass for Odilo. It was written in the first half of the twelfth
                    century. The two volumes were certainly together in the later Middle Ages, when an ownership
                    inscription of St Swithun's cathedral priory, Winchester with a contents list was entered on a
                    flyleaf.</p>

                <p>The provenance of CCCC MS 329 gives every appearance of being firmly established as originating from
                    the Benedictine priory of Thetford (Norfolk). Written c. 1425-50, the manuscript contains a number
                    of texts associating it with the priory of the Blessed Virgin Mary. These include a statement about
                    the authorship of John Bramis (fl. fourteenth century) of the <title>Historia regis Waldei</title>,
                    to the unique copy of the <title>History of Thetford priory</title> by Geoffrey of Rocherio OSB (d.
                    1301), both texts found in this volume. There is also an anonymous account of a miracle attending
                    the repairs carried out on the buildings of the priory. Yet, as James observed, another anonymous
                        <title>Chronicle</title> from the incarnation to the year 1399, that also appears in this
                    manuscript, takes a close interest in the affairs of the nearby priory of Augustinian canons at
                    Ixworth (Suffolk). Parker no doubt valued it for its account of church history from his home county
                    of Norfolk, but how it came into his possession is not known.</p>

                    gloss on the text found in the other, they were originally separate manuscripts. The first part,
                    written either in Normandy or in England probably in the early twelfth century, contains the
                        <title>De nuptiis Philologiae et Mercurii</title> by the late antique author, Martianus Capella.
                    It has an <hi rend="italic">ex libris</hi> inscription of Malmesbury abbey, and contains writing in
                    the hand of William of Malmesbury OSB (c. 1080-1143). It may have been William himself who combined
                    it with the second part, which contains a commentary on Martianus Capella probably either by Dunchad
                    (9th century) or Martin of Laon. The same text is found in <ref type="ms" n="CCC153">CCCC MS

                <p>CCCC MS 337, dating to the fourteenth century, contains two main texts. The first is the <title>Liber
                        scintillarum</title> of Defensor of Ligugé (late seventh century), a florilegium of biblical and
                    patristic sayings arranged according to themes. The second is the <title>Summa Qui bene
                        praesunt</title> by Richard of Wetheringsett (fl. c. 1200-30), first recorded chancellor of
                    Cambridge University at some time between 1215 and 1232. This is a guide for preachers structured in
                    the manner of a catechism according to the Creed, the Lord's Prayer etc. It is one of the earliest
                    pastoral texts of this sort which were initiated by the reforms of the Fourth Lateran Council of
                    1215. Formerly the author of this text was thought to be William de Montibus (d. 1213). The book
                    might have belonged to the cathedral priory of Christ Church, Canterbury, but that provenance is
                    doubtful.</p>

            <div xml:id="CCC338" n="MS 338">
                <p>CCCC MS 338, written in a German script of the sixteenth century, contains a copy of <title>Von der
                        Herrlichkeit Christi</title> by Caspar Schwenckfeld (or Kaspar von Schwenkfeld of Ossig)
                    (1489/90-1561). Schwenckfeld was a Reformation theologian from Silesia and his writings formed the
                    bases for a Protestant group known as the Schwenkfelders.</p>

                <p>CCCC MS 339 contains two distinct volumes, the first of which has been claimed by some as the
                    autograph working copy of the <title>Chronicon de tempore regis Ricardi</title> by Richard of
                    Devizes OSB (fl. late twelfth century), a monk of Winchester, and the <title>Annales
                        Wintonienses</title>. The second volume contains a fourteenth-century copy of the
                        <title>Compilatio de gestis Britonum et Anglorum</title> by Peter of Ickham OSB (d. 1295). The
                    provenance of this manuscript is uncertain. The earlier portion of the codex may have been produced
                    at the Benedictine cathedral priory of St Peter, St Paul, and St Swithun at Winchester, around 1200,
                    while an early fifteenth-century note appended to the second volume is concerned with events in the
                    Augustinian abbey of the Blessed Virgin at Lilleshall in Shropshire. Neither of these provenances
                    have been wholly accepted The manuscript may once have been in the hands of the historian John Bale
                    (1495-1563) before it came into Parker's possession.</p>

                    (1500-62). There is material here relating to the course of the Reformation both in England and on

                    chronicle of English history covers the period c. 1066-c. 1122. However, loose within the book are
                    two inserted fragments: one, a leaf from Eadmer, <title>Historia nouorum</title>, and the other from
                    Eadmer, <title>Vita Anselmi</title>. Both leaves date from the first half of the twelfth century,
                    and are believed to be autograph copies of Eadmer's works. Their provenance has thus been identified

            <div xml:id="CCC342" n="MS 342">
                <p>CCCC MS 342 demonstrates that Matthew Parker was not solely concerned to acquire original copies of
                    manuscript material that interested him, but that he actively sought to propagate new copies of
                    texts. This manuscript contains a version of the <title>Flores historiarum</title> (<title>Annales
                        ecclesiae Roffensis</title>) with a particular emphasis on events in Rochester, sometimes
                    attributed to Edmund of Haddenham OSB (fl. c. 1300), a monk of Rochester or John of Rainham OSB (d.
                    1294), prior of Rochester. This text was copied, on Parker's instructions, directly from BL Cotton
                    Nero D.II, itself in the hands of Parker's secretary, John Joscelin (1529-1603) at the time.
                    Parker's characteristic red chalk underlining in this volume reveals his interest in the subject of
                    clerical marriage, a matter of more than public and historical interest to the Archbishop of
                    Canterbury who was, despite Queen Elizabeth I's objections, a married man.</p>

                <p>CCCC MS 343 contains fourteenth-century copies of historical material of the kind that interested
                    Parker. In this instance the texts include Ralph Niger (d. c. 1210), to whose
                        <title>Chronicum</title>, covering the period from the Creation to 1199, has been added extracts
                    from the <title>Chronicon Anglicanum</title> by Ralph of Coggeshall OCist (d. after 1224), and a
                    copy of Coggeshall's <title>Chronicon terrae sanctae et de captis a Saladino Hierosolymis</title>.
                    In addition, the manuscript contains a handful of other texts of a varied nature, including verses
                    on weights and measures, a guide to playing chess, a gospel parody (<title>Sequencia leti euuangelii
                        secundum lucrum</title>) and a short history of the dukes of Normandy from William I to John.
                    The flyleaves of the volume are made up of two leaves of a late fifteenth-century abstract version
                    of the <title>Polychronicon</title> by Ranulf Higden OSB (d. 1364). Nothing is known of the

                <p>Parker acquired CCCC MS 347 from Norwich cathedral priory, and it was one of three that the priory
                    had been bequeathed by their former owner, Cardinal Adam Easton OSB (c. 1330-97), that Parker
                    secured (see also <ref type="ms" target="CCC074">CCCC MSS 74</ref> and <ref type="ms"

                    Profatius Iudaeus (Jacob ben Machir) (fl. 1288-1301) and other astrological material, a Norwich

                        <title>Expositio quorundam terminorum astrologicorum</title>. It was almost certainly once part
                    of the Cardinal's reputedly extensive personal library. If so, it was probably among the 228 books
                    from that source which arrived in Norwich, packed in six barrels, in 1407, ten years after Easton's

                    he regarded as important, but actually creating new copies of them. This codex contains two distinct
                    texts, one, the <title>Chronica minora</title> of Matthew Paris OSB (c. 1195-1259), is copied from
                    the version of the same text now in BL Royal 14.C.VII. The same manuscript was used as the basis for
                    a much fuller transcription now in <ref type="ms" target="CCC056">CCCC MS 56</ref>. The second text
                    in this manuscript is a transcription of a number of Anglo-Saxon law codes from Alfred to Cnut

                        target="CCC096">CCCC MS 96</ref>. Both texts reveal Parker's interest in English history, and in

                    Winchester. The other copy, Lambeth Palace Library MS 183, is an incomplete late fifteenth-century
                    version of the text from which the edition in the Corpus manuscript is a direct copy made in the
                    sixteenth century, possibly (though not certainly) for Parker. As such, CCCC MS 350 should probably
                    join other Corpus manuscripts such as <ref type="ms" target="CCC056">56</ref>, <ref type="ms"

                    minuscule', a Southumbrian English variety of Insular minuscule. It is quite a large format book,
                    elegantly written with large margins, and was probably always intended to contain the glosses which
                    have been added by contemporary and slightly later hands. The manuscript may have had a Welsh
                    exemplar. It has later provenance at St Augustine's, Canterbury and is included in its medieval

                    early and mid-thirteenth century. No doubt this was what attracted Parker to the manuscript,
                    concerned as he was with the relationship between church and state. A donation inscription records
                    that the book was given to the church at Burton by William de Swepston, possibly (though not
                    certainly) indicating that this volume was once at the Benedictine abbey of the Blessed Virgin and

                <p>The commentaries on the Epistle to the Romans and on Genesis contained in CCCC MS 355 are by John
                    Colet (1467-1519), one of the early humanists in England, who had been to Italy and was influenced
                    by early Renaissance scholarship. The commentary on Romans originated as a lecture in Oxford given
                    in the late 1490s, and was expanded and revised, as in this manuscript copy, addressed to a young
                    man named Edmund. It heralds a departure from the still prevalent scholastic mode of exegesis. It is
                    written in humanist script by Peter Meghen (1466/7-1540), a Brabantine scribe who worked extensively
                    for the English early sixteenth-century humanists. The manuscript was probably made in the first or
                    second decades of the sixteenth century. John Colet seems first to have employed Meghen in 1505,
                    although he continued to work in England into the 1520s. Blank spaces indicate the intention to
                    include miniatures and ornamental intials, but regrettably this work was never carried out.</p>

                    they featured material copied for its form rather than its particular content, letters within such

                    Anglo-Saxon. The provenance of this manuscript is unknown.</p>

                <p>MS 360 contains a collection of sermons compiled by John Felton (d. 1434). Linguistic analysis of the
                    oldest manuscripts of this work have been used to argue that John Felton was from the north of
                    England, possibly Northumberland. He is first recorded as the vicar of Melchbourne, Bedfordshire in
                    1390 and in 1397 became the vicar of St Mary Magdalen, Oxford, where he remained for the rest of his
                    life. His sermon collection is largely a compilation of notes from the model sermons available at
                    the time. It was originally compiled in 1431, with this manuscript dating to the middle of the
                    fifteenth century. The popularity of the work is attested to by the number of surviving
                    manuscripts.</p>

                    of the reign of Edward III. By the time that this copy of the <title>Statuta</title> was made, most
                    versions were probably copied from exemplars held by professional scribes, which means that the
                    occasional presence of a writ to a particular sheriff or official is no guide to the likely
                    provenance of the manuscript. The formal nature of the script, the spaces left for rubricated
                    capitals, the presence of chapter numbers and frequent, though inconsistent, marginal headings,
                    suggests that this book was intended as a formal copy for a practising lawyer. It was not uncommon
                    for such material to be added to in later years, and, in this manuscript, material dating from the
                    reign of Richard II has been added in a different hand.</p>

                    1364), and a chronicle attributed to Thomas Harpsfield. The second consists of a number of fragments
                    of Old English material, copied in the second half of the eleventh or the early twelfth century, and
                    probably to be associated with Worcester: they contain the <title>De temporibus anni</title> by
                    Ælfric of Eynsham OSB (d. 1010), and some homiletic fragments, now out of order. The third volume is
                    a thirteenth- or fourteenth-century copy of Robert Kilwardby OP (d. 1279), <title>De natura
                        relationis</title>. The fourth is a thirteenth-century copy of the <title>Apocalypsis
                        Goliae</title>, a satirical Latin poem sometimes associated with Walter Map (c. 1140-1210), but

                    copied at various times in the fourteenth, early fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. The most
                    substantial text in this slim volume is a chronicle from the arrival of the Saxons to the reign of
                    Henry III with continuations in various hands down to 1337. This section can probably be dated c.
                    1425. The basis of the chronicle in this manuscript was identified by Hardy in the late nineteenth
                    century as being a work by John Bever (d. c. 1311) known as the <title>Brutus abbreuiato</title>.

                    (before 1230-1278), a history of the Roman emperors and the papacy. Martin's work was extremely
                    influential on the work of other chroniclers, including English writers, and it is not to be
                    wondered that Parker possessed more than one copy of the work (see <ref type="ms" target="CCC059"
                        >CCCC MS 59</ref>, <ref type="ms" target="CCC194">194</ref>). In addition, this manuscript
                    contains a number of later fifteenth-century additions, including a list of tithes and a royal writ,
                    which seem to indicate that this manuscript was once connected to Suffolk. Beyond that, nothing is

                    whose request it was written. However, it is now known that the manuscript is the unique copy of an
                    anonymous chronicle, closely modelled on Ekkehard's work, but also incorporating material from the
                        <title>World Chronicle</title> (ending c.1111) of Sigebert of Gembloux (c. 1029/9-1112),
                    continued down to 1114, shortly after which date this copy was produced in Germany. It seems to be
                    by an anonymous author working in Wurzburg 1112-13. The book is illustrated by pen drawings in brown
                    and red of the enthroned kings and emperors. Recent research has suggested that the codex may have
                    been donated to the monastery at Bec by the Empress Matilda (c. 1102-67), from where it travelled to
                    Rochester, possibly being lent for copying in the late twelfth century. It may be identified with
                    the volume described as <title>Cronica Francorum i volumen</title> in Rochester library's catalogue
                    of 1202, and if so it was presumably from there that it found its way, together with many other

                    history of England said to have been drawn from 'multa et uariis autoribus' and written somewhat
                    earlier than the <title>Brut</title>. The presence of the letters 'TW' in Parker's characteristic
                    red chalk has been taken to mean that the volume came to Parker via either John Twyne (1507-81) or
                    Thomas Wotton (1521-87) and, therefore, probably from Canterbury - possibly St Augustine's. However,
                    the most recent survey of the library of St Augustine's agrees with Neil Ker's earlier rejection of

                    twelfth-century Calendar which James, somewhat elliptically, described as having 'a certain German
                    flavour'. The second item, which makes up the greater part of the manuscript, is a late
                    fourteenth-century collection of English statutes (or material such as writs and letters patent
                    conventionally accorded the status of statutes). To this has been added the third item, a
                    fifteenth-century list of religious who possessed temporalities in the diocese of Ely. Nothing is
                    known of how these disparate texts came to be included in the same codex, or how it came into

                    for use at Cambridge University. This manuscript contains what may be the primary, and only extant,
                    copy of William Chubbes' introduction to logic, the <title>Bene fundatum</title> (<title>Introductio
                        logices</title>). Chubbes was the first Master of Jesus College, Cambridge, from 1497 to his
                    death in 1505 and perhaps it was this Cambridge connection that interested Parker in this
                    manuscript. On ff. 74v and 75r there are drawings of various sorts of 'bodies' which seem to be
                    intended to illustrate the concepts of logic in the preceding text.</p>

                    for his interest in Anglo-Saxon texts. It contains notes and excerpts from texts in Latin, Greek and
                    Old English from both manuscripts and early printed books as well as runic inscriptions. This
                    notebook has attracted attention both as an artefact of sixteenth-century efforts to learn Old
                    English, and due to the transcription of a large portion of the preface to Genesis by Ælfric of
                    Eynsham (d. 1010) from the now lost first folio of BL Cotton Claudius B.IV. Much of the material in
                    this notebook relates to Talbot's interest in topographical nomenclature, such as his extensive
                    notes on the British section of the <title>Itinerarii Antonini</title>. The Latin version of
                    Oppian's <title>Halieutica</title> with a brief biographical note on the author on ff. 2r-7v appears

                    of Peter Lombard (c. 1095-1160). It has fine historiated and ornamental initials by the Simon

                <p>CCCC MS 383 is a late eleventh- or early twelfth-century manuscript, possibly from St Paul's
                    Cathedral in London. It contains a very early version of the Anglo-Saxon law codes as they were
                    gathered together to form part of the textual tradition known as the <title>Quadripartitus</title>.
                    Parker was no doubt fascinated by the presence of Anglo-Saxon material in this volume, which
                    contains a number of texts unique to it, such as the <title>Gerefa</title>. The manuscript was, at
                    some stage, in the hands of Robert Talbot, prebendary of Norwich (d. 1558) and contains notes in his
                    hand as well as that of Parker's secretary, John Joscelyn (1529-1603). It has been much studied
                    throughout its history; the sixteenth-century antiquarians' notes accompany glosses dating from the
                    thirteenth century .</p>

                    donation inscription stating the donor to have been one Thomas Dag (or Day). That this manuscript is
                    missing from Thomas James' catalogue of 1600 suggests that this manuscript did not find its way into
                    the college until the early seventeenth century.</p>

                    been bound together. The first part is a tract on the sins of monks which analyses the doubts and
                    temptations which confront a monk. Part two is written at St Albans in his own hand by Matthew Paris
                    OSB (d. 1259) and contains William of Conches (c. 1080-1154), <title>Dragmaticon</title>, with some
                    diagrams drawn by Matthew Paris. This manuscript has been used in the edition of the
                        <title>Dragmaticon</title> by Ronca. The third part, dating to c. 1400, has a Middle English
                    sermon based on Richard of Saint-Victor OSA (d. 1173), <title>Beniamin minor</title> and other short
                    Middle English devotional texts. The fourth part contains the apocryphal gospel, the
                        <title>Euangelium Nicodemi</title>, and some exempla and stories. Although at the beginning of
                    the first part there is an early sixteenth-century inscription of ownership of a monk of Canterbury,
                    this may be false, and the book cannot be identified in the catalogues of any of the Canterbury

                    followed by a manuscript collection of fourteenth and fifteenth-century treatises on the various
                    disciplines of written composition and aids to producing texts. These include <title>De

                    to John of Garland (d. c. 1272), an incomplete version of Alanus ab Insula (Alain de Lille, c.
                    1128-1203) <title>Liber parabolarum</title>, and a collection of verses. The dating for this last

                    ornamental borders and initials, and is notable for its very large size. It belonged to the

                    Latin and Anglo-Norman and were copied c. 1330. As such, it throws an interesting light on the
                    creation and transmission of multi-lingual texts in later medieval England. An analysis of the
                    Middle English components of this volume suggests that it was written or copied by an author who
                    employed a linguistic style that has been localised to East Anglia in the vicinity of Ely. Other
                    than this, there are no clues as to the manuscript's provenance.</p>

                <p>CCCC MS 389 was written at St Augustine's, Canterbury in the late tenth century, and contains
                    Jerome's <title>Life of St Paul the First Hermit</title> and the <title>Life of St Guthlac</title>
                    by Felix of Crowland (eighth century). These are two very important texts for the anchoritic
                    tradition: Jerome's <title>Life of St Paul</title> provided a model both for subsequent hermits and
                    for those who wrote their <title>uitae</title>; while Guthlac was the original English hermit,
                    pursuing his vocation in the wilderness of the fens rather than in the middle-eastern desert. This
                    manuscript therefore shows an interest in the eremitical way of life at Canterbury at this time,
                    further emphasised by the marking up of the Guthlac text into nine lections to be used on his feast
                    day. It was written in late Square minuscule, the last type of Insular script to be used for Latin
                    texts in England, and contains wonderful initials of Wormald's "Type II", with interlace work and
                    grasping beast heads outlined in ink. In the second half of the eleventh century, perhaps circa
                    1070, an author portrait of St Jerome was added at the start of the manuscript in a late Anglo-Saxon
                    style. The manuscript has a St Augustine's, Canterbury classmark, but is not included in the
                    surviving catalogue.</p>

                <p>CCCC MS 390 is the kind of manuscript that always interested Parker. It contains the late twelfth- or

                    Wales (1146-1226). As such, it surely appealed to Parker's interest both in the oldest manuscripts
                    and in those dealing with history in general, and ecclesiastical history in particular. The later
                    medieval provenance of this manuscript is evinced by a fifteenth-century contents list written by
                    'Morganus canonicus de Kermerden', whose name and hand appear in a number of manuscripts known to
                    have been in the library of the Augustinian priory of the Blessed Virgin and St John the Baptist at

                <p>CCCC MS 391 is a portiforium, that is a Breviary, from Worcester. It contains a large variety of
                    material, including a psalter and prognostical texts. It was written at a time when the various
                    elements of the divine office were drawn together into a single book, the Breviary. This book
                    represents the text in a primitive form. In the late Middle Ages it was associated with St Oswald,
                    bishop of Worcester and archbishop of York, who died in 992. However, the calendar has Oswald's name
                    in the original hand, and the script dates the manuscript later, as was first pointed out by
                    Parker's secretary John Joscelyn (1529-1603). It is now known as the <title>Portiforium of St
                        Wulfstan</title>, after Wulfstan, bishop of Worcester 1062-95, not to be confused with Wulfstan
                    the homilist (d. 1023). It is usually dated to the late 1060s. At the beginning of the psalter there
                    is a framed tinted drawing of David harping and a large ornamental initial for the first psalm.</p>

                    Markaunt (c. 1382-1439), fellow, among 76 books. Only five of these books still remain in the
                    College Library; the others must have been dispersed at some time in the sixteenth century. The
                    illustrations are related to several other copies of the Anglo-Norman prose Apocalypse made in
                    England in the late thirteenth and first half of the fourteenth century. This copy is by a

                    Rupescissa OFM (Roqetaillade, d. c. 1362 - pseudo-Ramon Lull), his <title>Liber de consideratione
                        quintae essentiae</title>. This section contains a few diagrams and coloured drawings, notably
                    two full-page (ff. 49v-50r) illustrating lunaria grass. The style of this drawing and some texts in
                    Catalan, suggest this part may have been made in Catalonia. Textual additions have been made by an
                    English scribe, and the book seems to have come to England by the second half of the fifteenth
                    century. In addition to a number of other minor alchemical tracts, the codex also contains a number
                    of works attributed to Robert Green of Welby (c. 1467-after 1544), including <title>De fama</title>,
                        <title>Quaestiones super benedicti lapidis philosophici compositione</title>,

                        <title>Matali' al-Anzar, Sharh Tawali' al-Anwar</title>. It is one of a small handful of Arabic
                    manuscripts possessed by Parker. The greater part of the manuscript is in a sixteenth-century hand
                    but Parker wrote a note on the flyleaf indicating his belief that the codex had once belonged to
                    Theodore of Tarsus, archbishop of Canterbury (d. 690) and no doubt it was this misapprehension, as
                    much as Parker's interest in unusual scripts, that led him to acquire the volume. Parker's belief
                    that this manuscript was once in the possession of an early predecessor as archbishop may indicate
                    that the volume was acquired from a library in Canterbury, but beyond this, nothing is known of the
                    provenance of this manuscript.</p>

                    intended for anchoresses or nuns, written in the first half of the thirteenth century. There is much
                    controversy as to when, where and by whom it was written, but possibly it was by a Dominican writing
                    in the West Midlands in the 1230s. Others have argued for authorship by an Augustinian canon, also
                    writing in the West Midlands in the first third of the century. CCCC MS 402, once considered to be
                    one of the earliest versions of the text, is now thought to be of the late thirteenth century. The
                    MS has recently been published in an authoritative new edition by Bella Millett, collated with

                    and later prior of the abbey of Bury St Edmunds; he was known formerly as Boston of Bury. The

                <p>CCCC MS 405 was formed from several manuscripts dating from the early thirteenth century and the

                    of St. John of Jerusalem) temple at Kilbarry, near Waterford in Ireland and contains an Irish
                    monastic calendar, liturgical offices, a collection of texts and verses, predominantly in
                    Anglo-Norman, and numerous transcribed documents, mainly in Latin, relating to the Knights
                    Hospitallers and the borough of Waterford. The volume has been used as evidence of the wide usage of
                    Anglo-Norman in Ireland and to demonstrate the variety of tracts available to Ireland's monastic
                    communities as well as being an important source regarding the city of Waterford due to the civic

                    these is what is thought to be one of the earliest versions of the 'A' recension of Seneca's
                        <title>Tragoediae</title> to be copied in England. The text has been much used and discussed by
                    modern editors of Seneca's <title>Tragedies</title>. Alongside this there appears a broad variety of
                    texts typical of a monastic or university commonplace book including satirical verse, classical
                    history, cosmology and poetics. The texts include the <title>Architrenius</title> of Iohannes de
                    Alta Villa (fl. late twelfth century) and the <title>Anticlaudianus</title> of Alanus ab Insula

                    Châtillon (fl. c. 1160-90) <title>Alexandreis</title>, the first part of Bernardus Silvestris (d.

                    fourteenth century. The first is a series of travelogues including Simon Simeonis OFM (d. after
                    1322) <title>Itinerarium in terram sanctam</title>, Willelmus de Rubruk OFM (c. 1215-c. 1270)

                    of Pordenone (c. 1286-1331). The second type of material, written in a different hand, includes the
                    Arabic version of the <title>Secretum secretorum</title> translated by Philip of Tripoli (fl. c.
                    1243) and another broadly medical treatise, <title>De complexione humana</title>. This volume was
                    owned by, and quite probably copied for, Simon Bozoun OSB (d. 1352), prior of Norwich Cathedral
                    Priory, as revealed by an inscription on the first folio. The manuscript was almost certainly
                    acquired by Parker from Norwich.</p>

                    a historical collection established around the theme of illustrious men named Henry. It is thought
                    that this manuscript represents Capgrave's autograph version, intended for copying by scribes at the
                    Austin friars' convent at King's Lynn, and was almost certainly written in 1446-7, since it records
                    Henry VI's visit to King's Lynn in 1446 but not the death of Humphrey, duke of Gloucester, in the
                    following year. On the basis of the press mark, it has been stated that the manuscript was once at
                    the Benedictine abbey at Bury St Edmunds, although this has been disputed. It has also been argued
                    that this manuscript was once in the collection of the historian, John Bale (1495-1563).</p>

                    thirteenth or early fourteenth century. This manuscript is a compendium consisting of a c. 1425
                    volume containing Oddington's work, and a later fifteenth-century paper volume containing a treatise
                    on mensural music by the French theorist Iohannes de Muris (c. 1290-c. 1344), and an anonymous
                    English treatise on descant. It serves as a remarkable witness to the diversity of both practical

                <p>This Psalter gives interesting evidence of relations between England and the Continent in the late
                    tenth century. It has some very Franco-Saxon decoration, but seems to have been written by the
                    English scribe also responsible for <ref type="ms" target="CCC214">CCCC MS 214</ref>, and has a
                    line-drawing of a standing man (David?) in a very English style, perhaps an early addition to
                    provide a frontispiece, in one of its Franco-Saxon frames. The Franco-Saxon style of illumination
                    draws heavily on earlier Insular decoration, particularly in its use of interlace and beast heads,
                    but was developed on the Continent rather than in any part of the original Insular homelands. This
                    manuscript probably attests to Continental influence on English book-production at Christ Church,
                    Canterbury in the late tenth century, but it has alternatively been supposed that it was made
                    abroad, perhaps at Tours, and imported early into England. English additions were made to the book
                    in the eleventh century, including a second litany and the drawing of the standing man. An early
                    modern note claims that the book, once decorated with silver gilt and jewels, was owned by two
                    archbishops of Canterbury including Thomas Becket (d. 1170). Parker does not seem to have celebrated
                    the association with this saint, whose influence on English affairs he is unlikely to have
                    considered positive.</p>

                        principum</title>, written between 1297 and 1314, perhaps for the sons of Philip the Fair. It

                    copy of the <title>Articuli cleri</title> (1316) that is attached to the beginning of the volume and
                    which deals with the question of royal and ecclesiastical jurisdiction. This is followed by a series
                    of notes bearing the name Edmund Poplay, who seems to have been confirmed as a bachelor of canon law
                    at Cambridge University in 1489, though no contemporary reference to him is known in the university

                    postulated an East Anglian provenance on the basis of the script and decoration, but this has never

                    appellation as 'The Norman (or 'Rouen') Anonymous'. The manuscript, which was copied in the late
                    eleventh or early twelfth century, consists of a number of tracts which have as their broad theme
                    the relationship between the spiritual and temporal power. It has special significance because it
                    was written shortly after the Investiture Controversy; this controversy was over the power of lay
                    princes to invest and receive homage from abbots and bishops, which was forbidden by Pope Gregory
                    VII in 1075. Although frequently discussed in the literature of the history of the relationship
                    between the medieval church and state, the unique private nature of the text makes it highly
                    unlikely that the complex ideas expressed in it ever gained a wide readership.</p>

                    enthronement of Archbishop William Wareham (c. 1456-1532) in 1503. Parker no doubt wanted to add

                    previous incumbent as archbishop, both themes that are found throughout his collection. The

                    miniature of the Entry into Jerusalem taken from the same French thirteenth-century psalter as the

                    versions produced in Parker's lifetime. The first portion of the collection contains various
                    manuscript tracts in Latin and English copied in the sixteenth century, the first of which is the
                    preface to the <title>Prognosticatio</title> of Johannes Lichtenberger (d. 1503). The name John
                    Eston appears in two places in the volume, though he and his relationship to Parker, if any, has not

                <p>CCCC MS 421 is an important collection of Old English homilies, many by Ælfric of Eynsham OSB (d.
                    1010). It originated in the first half of the eleventh century as a companion volume to <ref

                    additions were made to MS 421 at at Exeter in the time of Bishop Leofric (1050-1072). The manuscript
                    contains an eleventh-century frontispiece drawing of the Crucifixion in the part (p. 1) which was
                    originally in <ref type="ms" target="CCC419">CCCC MS 419</ref>. MS 421 was Parker's sixth volume of

            <div xml:id="CCC422" n="MS 422">
                <p>CCCC MS 422 consists of two parts, which were together by the twelfth century. The first, a
                    tenth-century volume, contains two Old English texts about the dialogue between Solomon and Saturn,
                    one in poetry (also found in <ref type="ms" target="CCC041">CCCC MS 41</ref>) and one in prose. This
                    is an example of a type of Old English wisdom literature which was influenced by Old Norse examples.
                    The second part is a Missal, known as <title>The Red Book of Darley</title> because of its later
                    provenance at the church of St Helen, Darley Dale, in the Lake District. Its Easter table suggest
                    that it was written in the 1060s, probably circa 1061. Its calendar contains rare feasts pertaining
                    to Sherborne in Dorset, and the manuscript was probably written there. It has been suggested that it
                    is associable with Ælfwold, bishop of Sherborne 1045–1062. The Missal section contains ornamental
                    initials and drawings of Christ between angels and of the Crucifixion. This manuscript was given to
                    Parker by Richard Wendesley.</p>

                    collection of letters and documents regarding the University of Oxford mostly relating to the church
                    and theology, and a copy of the Ten Commandments in Middle English verse. The second and third
                    parts, of the late fifteenth century, contain a collection of material on preaching including Thomas
                    Penketh OESA (d. 1487), <title>Ars sermocinandi</title>, Simon Alcock (d. 1459), <title>De modo

            <div xml:id="CCC424" n="MS 424">
                <p>CCCC MS 424 is comprised of a number of disparate elements, with six volumes bound together
                    containing material from different centuries. The manuscript begins with three printed pamphlets, an
                    epitome of Galen by Christopher Heyll, an account of the marriage of Philip of Spain and Mary I of
                    England and of a speech given by the Cardinal of Lorraine in 1561. The manuscript material proper is
                    a jumble of medical, astrological and spiritual treatises such as the <title>Regimen sanitatis
                        Salernitanum</title>, Robert Grosseteste (d. 1253), <title>De impressionibus aeris siue De
                        prognosticatione</title> and Thomas de Frakaham OSA (fl. c. 1200) <title>Speculum spiritalis
                        amicitiae</title> copied in various hands between the thirteenth and the fifteenth centuries. In
                    addition the codex includes an earlier twelfth-century copy of the legend of Aseneth in a Latin
                    translation from the Greek.</p>

            <div xml:id="CCC425" n="MS 425">
                <p>CCCC MS 425 consists of two once-separate volumes. The first contains the unique surviving copies of
                    two hagiographical works by Gerald of Wales (1146-1226), his lives of St Remigius and St Hugh. It
                    has been suggested that the manuscript could be an autograph, and on these grounds has been located
                    to Lincoln between 1209 and 1223. The second volume is a c. 1450 copy of letters of Peter of Blois
                    (d. 1212). The two were probably combined by Matthew Parker. He added a table of contents and the
                    initials "TW" to the start of the first volume, perhaps suggesting that he acquired it from one of
                    the Twynes or from Thomas Wootton.</p>

                    from c. 1475, is made up of extracts containing descriptions of the Holy Land from <title>Opus
                        maius</title> (pt. iv, sec. 5: <title>Geographia</title>) by Roger Bacon (c. 1214-c. 1292),
                        <title>The travels of Sir John Mandeville</title> (possibly by Jean le Long, d. 1388) and a
                    third, unidentified text as well as a copy of Bede's <title>De locis sanctis</title>. The tracts by
                    Bede and Roger Bacon are both incomplete, lacking their final sections. At the end of
                        <title>Mandeville's Travels</title> there is a full-page map of the Holy Land.</p>

                <p>CCCC MS 427 is a collection of chronicles in a series of fifteenth-century hands. Its contents
                    include the <title>Chronica pontificum et imperatorum</title> of Martin of Troppau OP (d. 1278),
                        <title>Compilatio de gestis Britonum et Anglorum</title> of Peter of Ickham OSB (d. 1295) with a
                    continuation to 1427, an abridgement of the <title>Historia destructionis Troiae</title>, written in
                    1287 by Guido de Columnis (not to be confused with his namesake Guido delle Colonne - d. c. 1280),
                    an abstract of Bede's <title>Historia ecclesiastica</title> and another chronicle which may be based
                    on the <title>Speculum historiale</title> of Richard of Cirencester OSB (d. 1401). This material
                    typifies Parker's interest in manuscripts of English and wider history which he employed to ensure
                    the sound historical foundations of his ideas for the future of the reformed church in England.</p>

            <div xml:id="CCC428" n="MS 428">
                <p>CCCC MS 428 contains a sixteenth-century collection of extracts from the Early Christian Fathers on
                    tradition compiled by John Baret (c.1495-1563). His name is sometimes given as Barrett or Barret.
                    Baret was a Carmelite and a Reformation theologian. The Parker Library also holds two further
                    collections of theological extracts compiled by him: <ref type="ms" target="CCC413">CCCC MS

                    which was often attributed to Seneca in the Middle Ages; Ferrandus (d. 546/7), deacon of Carthage,
                        <title>Ad Reginum comitem</title>, on Christian life for soldiers; and a sermon by Ambrosius
                    Autpertus (d. 784). It was written in the late ninth or very early tenth century at the abbey of
                    Saint-Amand in northern France, but was exported to England quite early, as is shown by
                    tenth-century additions it received probably at St Augustine's Abbey, Canterbury. It probably moved
                    again before the end of the middle ages, as it seems to be identifiable with a book seen at
                    Glastonbury Abbey by John Leland (1506-72), and may be mentioned in a Glastonbury inventory of 1247.
                    It constitutes interesting evidence for the transmission of texts from the Continent to England at
                    around the time of the Benedictine Reform Movement.</p>

            <div xml:id="CCC432" n="MS 432">

                        <title>Rains</title>) a history of the third crusade written in French. This copy, whose
                    illustrations have suffered a great deal of damage, bears a versified inscription by John Skelton
                    (d. 1529), written on the occasion of the manuscript's presentation to Henry VIII, Skelton's pupil.
                    Presumably it came into Parker's possession as a result of his contact either with the Henrician or
                    Elizabethan court, but the manuscript's exact route from the royal collection into Parker's is
                    unknown. The book contains eleven illuminated miniatures and two historiated initials, all much

                    volume are two Cluniac chronicles, one with much interest in affairs in the Welsh marches. The
                    volume also contains the tract <title>De miseria humanae conditionis</title> by Pope Innocent III
                    (1160/6-1219 - pope 1198-1216), the fable <title>De Mauro bubulco</title>, a version of the

                    of sermons. The Cluniac material has led to some speculation that this manuscript may be linked to
                    the Cluniac house of St Milburga at Much Wenlock, Shropshire, though this has been disputed.</p>

                    about the Christian faith, with the result that the brother translates for her parts of the New
                    Testament. The book contains a Middle English translation of the Catholic Epistles, Epistles of
                    Paul, Acts of the Apostles, and part of St. Matthew's Gospel. The text has been edited by Anna

                    unknown author, pseudo-Hugh of Saint-Cher, so called because his Apocalypse commentary with the
                    incipit <title>Vidit Iacob in sompnis</title> is sometimes attributed to Hugh of Saint-Cher OP (c.
                    1200-63) to whom several commentaries on that book are misattributed. The second text is a Latin

                    (fl. last third of eleventh century), once considered to be by the Roman poet Aemilius Macer. The
                    rest of the manuscript is taken up with material relating to the history of England and of
                    Canterbury in particular. Thus one finds in this codex thirteenth-century copies of the <title>Gesta
                        regum</title> and <title>Actus pontificum Cantuariensis ecclesiae</title> of Gervase of
                    Canterbury OSB (d. 1210), a fifteenth-century transcript of clerical taxation records and a copy of
                    the bull of 1170 authorising the canonization of Anselm of Canterbury. The contents and other notes

                    the needs of an individual patron. In this case the texts are penitential, moral, didactic and
                    theological tracts, with some material also relating to sermons. The book belonged to Richard de
                    Weynchepe, a monk, who became prior of the Benedictine priory of Dover in 1268, but the volume seems
                    to have reverted to the library of Dover's mother house, Christ Church, Canterbury; it is listed in

                    Quivel (c.1230–1291) is also known as Peter Quinel. The <title>Summula</title> is a reworking of the
                    confessional manual, <title>De confessione</title>, by the bishop of Worcester, Walter Cantilupe (d.

                    (d. c. 1187). It is considered to be in an East Midlands dialect and is the earliest English
                    paraphrase from the <title>Historia scholastica</title>. The title is misleading because the text
                    also contains paraphrases of sections of Leviticus, Deuteronomy and Numbers. The vocabulary and

                    the conclusion of each sentence. Known as the <title>Cursus</title>, this may have originated as a
                    way to try to prevent crude forgery of papal documents, but by the time that this copy of Richard's
                    work was copied, it had become a rigid system of stylistic conventions which necessitated handbooks

                    strongly-held beliefs. Among other texts it contains a poem from a certain Prosper to his wife;
                    Parker identified this Prosper with a bishop of that name, and therefore took it as evidence for
                    married bishops in the late antique or early medieval church. He had the text printed with a
                    translation, and this is now bound into the manuscript after f. 40, where it seems to be the unique
                    surviving copy. Parker married his wife, Margaret, before it became legal for priests to marry in
                    England; there is a story that they had both long before vowed never to marry another. They had a
                    happy and fruitful marriage, and Parker never recovered from her death in 1570, five years before

                    time Parker acquired it, and he had the missing parts of the text supplied by one of his own
                    scribes. Ælfric's <title>Grammar</title> was one of the first instructional texts on Latin to be
                    written in a vernacular; as such it was extremely useful for early modern scholars who could use the

                    Troy, the spurious correspondence of Alexander the Great, and proverbs in Latin and French. In

                    between the papacy and the thrones of England and France. Some of the material relates to Durham,

                    preserves a large amount of ecclesiastical history of this period that Parker and successive
                    generations of historians of the Church have found extremely useful. Presumably, Parker acquired
                    this manuscript more or less directly from Christ Church. After its acquisition a thirteenth-century

                    1235-53, copied c. 1430. The letters are an invaluable source for the sometimes brutal
                    ecclesiastical politics of the first half of the thirteenth century and the relationship between the
                    papacy, national churches and the monarchy. It was surely this that made the codex of such interest
                    to Parker, for whom such issues were very far from being mere historical curiosities. This
                    manuscript served as the basis for what remains the only standard edition of Grosseteste's letters,

                    The flyleaves contain various additions and notes in Latin and Welsh, including records of cases of
                    robbery and trespass, comments on the circumstances in which a marriage could be dissolved, and
                    notes on historical events. The manuscript also has three paper leaves which contain a printed copy

                    directions for the liturgical services throughout the Church year. The dating of the main text is
                    1258-65, but the calendar of Norwich Cathedral Priory at the beginning of the book was added

                    had presumably passed into the hands of Matthew Parker before 1575. Hare was a recusant - he gave
                    the famous manuscript by Thomas Elmham OSB (d. c. 1427) to Trinity Hall (MS 1) in Cambridge on
                    condition that it was returned to St Augustine's Canterbury if it was ever rebuilt - and his

                    years after the poem's original composition. Howden's exact identity is uncertain, but he was
                    probably a royal clerk in the household of Queen Eleanor of Provence, consort of Henry III and the
                    mother of Edward I. The poem is dedicated to Eleanor and is a reworking of Howden's earlier Latin
                    work, <title>Philomena</title>. The manuscript was probably in Parker's possession by 1564, as
                    revealed by a scribbled note bearing that date. Other notes record the name of 'Franciscus
                    Aldriche', but it seems unlikely that this is the same man who attended Clare College in the 1580s

                    Italian humanist scribes. Its contents includes Isidore of Seville (c. 560-636), <title>De ortu et
                        obitu patrum</title>, Pietro del Monte (c. 1400-57), <title>De uitiorum inter se differentia et

                    attests to the musical repertory of the Old Minster Winchester in the eleventh century. It contains
                    some of the oldest polyphonic music in the West. As well as 'tropes', musical phrases which were
                    added as embellishments to the standard chant for the liturgical texts, it also contains sequences
                    and other music. It would have been used by a precentor, whose job it was to lead the music at mass
                    and the divine office. There are many signs that it comes from the Old Minster Winchester, including
                    texts for the feasts of the Winchester saints Swithhun, Æthelwold, Justus of Beauvais, Hædde (Hedda)
                    and Birinus. Datings from the script have varied from circa 1000 to the second quarter of the
                    eleventh century; the earlier dating has led people to associate this manuscript with Wulfstan of
                    Winchester OSB (fl. late tenth century), also known as Wulfstan Cantor, who was precentor of the Old
                    Minster Winchester at around that date, and who wrote saints' lives and hagiographical poetry. A
                    later dating, perhaps 1020s-1030s, now seems probable, but it is still likely that at least some of
                    the material it contains is his work. Material was added to the manuscript serially over the course
                    of the eleventh century.</p>

                    abbey at Laon. James proposed a date for the manuscript in the first half of the twelfth century,

                    carried out in London and notes on proceedings at the London eyre of 1226. Most interesting is what

                    made use of this psalter. In the middle of the book are three coloured pictures of the Virgin and

                    marginal Latin transliterations of some of the psalms, and other notes in a variety of hands, which
                    link it with the circle of Robert Grosseteste (d. 1253). It was believed in Parker's time to have

                        <title>Liber deriuationum</title>, a dictionary attributed to the grammarian and canon lawyer,
                    Hugutio of Pisa (c. 1140/50-1210). Hugutio's <title>Deriuationes</title>, as it is sometimes called,
                    was one of the most popular books of its type in the late Middle Ages, particularly in schools. The
                    book has a contemporary binding with latch plates and traces of chain marks. This volume is part of
                    the Elbing collection; a group of manuscripts which belonged to a Brigittine convent at Elbing
                    (Elblag), near Gdansk. The collection was donated to Corpus Christi College by Richard Pernham
                    (1583?-1628) or his wife, Mary, whose signature is in several of the books.</p>

                    once belonged to the Brigittine convent of Elbing (Elblag), near Gdansk. The Elbing collection was
                    donated to Corpus Christi College by Richard Pernham (1583?-1628) or by his wife, Mary, whose
                    signature is in many of the books. The contents of MS 520 include the <title>De statu curiae
                        Romanae</title> by Henry of Würzburg (d. 1265), and <title>Aurora</title> by Petrus Riga (d.

                    Peter of Corbeil (c. 1150-1222). The final text contains extracts from the <title>Historia
                        scholastica</title> of Petrus Comestor (d. c. 1187). The manuscript also contains some notes in

                    be precisely dated to 1424-5 and 1388 respectively. The first volume, of 1424-5, contains a number
                    of tracts relating to prophecy, including the earliest version of the <title>Onus mundi</title> by
                    Johannes Tortsch (c. 1400-45), and Richard of Saint-Victor OSA (d. 1173), <title>De meditandis
                        plagis quae circa finem mundi euenient</title>. Also in this part are extracts from the
                        <title>Vitae Patrum</title> (<title>Vitas Patrum</title>, a compilation of lives of early monk
                    and hermit saints), the <title>Revelations</title> of the pseudo-Methodius, and at the end, of local
                    significance, the synodal statutes of the Henry III, Bishop of Varmia (1373-1401), formerly in East
                    Prussia but now in Poland (Warmia). The second, earlier, volume, contains a glossed hymnal, with a

                    convent at Elbing (Elblag), near Gdansk which was founded in 1458 and deserted in 1521. Almost all
                    the Elbing manuscripts contain the ownership inscription of Mary Pernham, wife of Richard Pernham

                <p>CCCC MS 535 is a German manuscript which contains a dictionary called <title>Brachylogus</title> by
                    the Dutch lexicographer, Johannes de Mera (fl. c. 1350). The dating of this manuscript is to the
                    last quarter of the fourteenth century. At the end of the text it is noted that the
                        <title>Brachylogus</title> was completed in 1354 in Mechelen. The book is decorated with many
                    fine large coloured ornamental initials. This volume is part of the Elbing collection; a group of
                    manuscripts which belonged to a Brigittine convent at Elbing (Elblag), near Gdansk. The collection
                    was donated to Corpus Christi College by either Richard Pernham (1583?-1628) or his wife Mary, whose

                    monastery of Königsaal (Zbraslav), near Prague. The name of its author has been controversial. He
                    was first thought to be a monk called Gallus, then one called Peter, and most recently the abbot of
                    Zbraslav in the second half of the fourteenth century, Iohannes of Frankenstein, has been proposed.
                    The text is in the form of spiritual advice as a guide on the road to perfection. Attendance at
                    Mass, and in particular frequent communion, is considered as essential to achieve this. The book was
                    probably made at Prague in the first quarter of the fifteenth century, and preserves its
                    contemporary binding with straps and bosses of bone or ivory. This volume is part of the Elbing
                    collection; a group of manuscripts which belonged to a Brigittine convent at Elbing (Elblag), near

                    Nationalbibliothek MS ser. nov. 9450, and New York, Public Library MS Spencer 49. It contains eight

                    Frances as a New Year’s gift at some point between their marriage in 1569 and his early death in
                    1574. It contains an acrostic on her name, as well as a number of “most necessary prayers and
                    comfortable meditations”, and the opening page has an illuminated border containing flowers like
                    those found in earlier sixteenth-century Books of Hours. Simpler gold borders are on several other
                    pages. Only the first few pages have been imaged because of the great fragility of the contemporary
                    binding, which is embroidered with pansies and chrysanthemums, in a similar style to the decoration
                    within. Frances was a renowned embroiderer, so may have made the binding herself. As a result of the
                    fragility of this binding it has only been possible to image the exterior and interior of the front
                    cover, the exterior of the back cover, and part of the text pages, ff. 1r-7v. The manuscript later
                    belonged to the Huth library, founded by Henry Huth (d. 1878) and continued by his son Alfred. It
                    was sold at auction in 1917, and was bought by Lord Queenborough (1861-1949) to give to Corpus
                    Christi College, perhaps at the instigation of the then librarian, Sir Geoffrey Butler. Frances was
                    the daughter of William Barlow, bishop of Chichester, who had assisted in Archbishop Parker’s
                    enthronement. At the time of her husband’s death Frances was pregnant with a child who did not
                    survive infancy. In 1578 she married Tobie Matthew, later Archbishop of York. She later founded York
                    Minster library with the books of her second husband, and was renowned for her views on girls’
                    education.</p>

                    traces the history of the world from Adam, via Noah and other Biblical figures, through such
                    legendary early kings as Lud and Arthur, down to the Anglo-Saxon kings. It concludes with Harold II,
                    and his death in the Norman Conquest of 1066. It is written in English, in a crabbed secretary hand.
                    Presumably it was copied from a medieval roll; however, usually such a genealogy would extend beyond
                    the Norman Conquest, so it is interesting that Ambrose Middelton chose to conclude at this

                    three copies were made of the Parker Register, listing Parker’s donations, one for each college, so
                    that the contents of the library could be checked against this list. CCCC MS 575 is the copy
                    belonging to Corpus Christi College, and contains annotations made by John Parker, Corpus fellow and
                    son of Matthew, who checked the books not long after his father’s death. It is not clear how
                    thoroughly these annual inspections were carried out - for one thing the three copies differ
                    slightly - but nonetheless the system was successful in that remarkably little of Parker’s
                    collection has been lost over the years. The 'audit' has been revived as an annual occurrence since

                <p>CCCC MS 583 is in the form of a short roll containing biographical notes about Matthew Parker
                    probably written by Parker himself and added to by his son, John Parker. It is one of a very small
                    number of sources that mentions, however briefly, his activities during the reign of Mary Tudor
                    (1553-8), an otherwise dark period in Parker's public life. It has been stated that this document
                    was probably donated to the college by Thomas Tenison, archbishop of Canterbury 1695-1715 (it was
                    certainly in the College's possession when Strype printed it from this unique copy in his 'Life' of
                    Parker in 1711), which may indicate that it was found among the archiepiscopal archives.</p>

                <p>CCCC MS 627 is a fragment of a papal bull of Adrian IV (1154-59). It is believed to have once formed
                    part of the binding of <ref type="ms" target="CCC183">CCCC MS 183</ref> and to have been removed
                    during conservation work in the early 1990s.</p>

                <p>The Revd. William Favell, an old member of the college (matric. 1922), gave this illuminated French
                    Psalter, CCCC MS 628, to Corpus Christi College in 1976. It was probably made in Paris c. 1240,
                    certainly after 1234 because St Dominic, canonised in that year, is in the Litany. At the liturgical
                    divisions of the Psalter there are eight fine full-page historiated initials. The figure style
                    derives out of that of the artists of the <title>Bibles moralisées</title> made for the French royal
                    family in the period c. 1220-40.</p>

                <p>CCCC MS 633 contains fragments (16 ff.) of a Greek Gospel Lectionary, written on paper in the late
                    fifteenth century. It was given to Corpus Christi College by Dr Scott Gwara in 1991.</p>

                <p>This cutting from a German Missal, CCCC MS 638, was given to Corpus Christi College by Dr Robert
                    Lefever in 2007. It is the <title>Te igitur</title> initial, the opening of the Canon of the Mass,
                    and comes from a Missal made in the third quarter of the fifteenth century, probably in Swabia. The
                    iconography is of female personifications of <hi rend="italic">Ecclesia</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                        >Synagoga</hi>, with the brazen serpent, a typological symbol of the Crucifixion, wound around
                    the initial T. The pelican piercing her breast, another type of the Crucifixion and special emblem
                    of Corpus Christi College, is in the upper decorative border. The arms on this page are of the von
                    Magenbuch family, and other cuttings from the same Missal with the same arms are in collections in
                    Philadelphia and Tokyo.</p>

                    Library by Andrew Johnson in 2008. The text is from First Vespers and Matins of the Seventh Sunday
                    after Pentecost. There are large calligraphic initials tinted in pale yellow for the responsory and

                <p>These eight leaves, CCCC MS 641, from a Spanish sixteenth-century Antiphoner of the use of Rome of
                    much larger size than the single leaf, <ref type="ms" target="CCC640">CCCC MS 640</ref>, were given
                    to the Parker Library by Andrew Johnson in 2008. The texts are from Lauds of Maundy Thursday, Matins
                    of Good Friday and Matins of Holy Saturday, but as some leaves are missing the text is not complete.
                    There are large calligraphic and coloured initials tinted in pale yellow for the responsories and
